# Authentication


Log in to Claude Code and configure authentication for individuals, teams, and organizations.


Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods depending on your setup. Individual users can log in with a Claude.ai account, while teams can use Claude for Teams or Enterprise, the Claude Console, or a cloud provider like Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry.

## 

[​](#log-in-to-claude-code)

Log in to Claude Code

After [installing Claude Code](/docs/en/setup#install-claude-code), run `claude` in your terminal. On first launch, Claude Code opens a browser window for you to log in. If the browser doesn’t open automatically, press `c` to copy the login URL to your clipboard, then paste it into your browser. You can authenticate with any of these account types:

- **Claude Pro or Max subscription**: log in with your Claude.ai account. Subscribe at [claude.com/pricing](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_pro_max).
- **Claude for Teams or Enterprise**: log in with the Claude.ai account your team admin invited you to.
- **Claude Console**: log in with your Console credentials. Your admin must have [invited you](#claude-console-authentication) first.
- **Cloud providers**: if your organization uses [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Vertex AI](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), or [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry), set the required environment variables before running `claude`. No browser login is needed.

To log out and re-authenticate, type `/logout` at the Claude Code prompt. If you’re having trouble logging in, see [authentication troubleshooting](/docs/en/troubleshooting#authentication-issues).

Claude for Teams or Enterprise

[Claude for Teams](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_teams#team-&-enterprise) and [Claude for Enterprise](https://anthropic.com/contact-sales?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_enterprise) provide the best experience for organizations using Claude Code. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with centralized billing and team management.

- **Claude for Teams**: self-service plan with collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams.
- **Claude for Enterprise**: adds SSO, domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API, and managed policy settings for organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

Credential management

Claude Code securely manages your authentication credentials:

- **Storage location**: on macOS, credentials are stored in the encrypted macOS Keychain.
- **Supported authentication types**: Claude.ai credentials, Claude API credentials, Azure Auth, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth.
- **Custom credential scripts**: the [`apiKeyHelper`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings) setting can be configured to run a shell script that returns an API key.
- **Refresh intervals**: by default, `apiKeyHelper` is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` environment variable for custom refresh intervals.
