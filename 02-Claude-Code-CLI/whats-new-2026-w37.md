Test plugins with claude plugin evalv2.1.269

`claude plugin eval` runs your plugin against a suite of test cases, scores the results, and by default runs each case again without the plugin so you can see what it contributes. `claude plugin eval init` asks you what a good result looks like, then proposes test cases and the checks that score them, tries the suite once, and writes the files. Every run, and every check that has a second model judge the reply, is a real model call on your account.

From your plugin’s root directory, have Claude draft the suite:

terminal

```python
claude plugin eval init
```

When Claude tells you the suite is ready, exit the session that `claude plugin eval init` opened and run `claude plugin eval .` to score every case. The summary table prints in your terminal, and `report.html` under `evals/results/` has the per-run detail.

[Test plugins with evals](../08-Plugins-Skills/plugin-evals.md)

Pop Desktop panes out into their own windowsDesktop

In the Claude Code Desktop app, you can pop any pane out into its own window. Drag the diff or terminal to a second screen while Claude keeps working in the main window, then dock the pane back when you’re done.

Other wins

Set [`maxEffortLevel`](settings-reference.md#maxeffortlevel) at the top level or per model under `modelSettings` to cap the effort level on every provider, including Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry; any higher level runs at the cap

Point `--plugin-dir` at a folder of plugins to [load each immediate subfolder that has a manifest](../08-Plugins-Skills/plugins-create.md#load-a-directory-or-archive-for-one-session)

If WebFetch hasn’t finished downloading a page within five minutes, [the fetch fails with a deadline error](tools-reference.md#webfetch-tool-behavior) instead of hanging; set `CLAUDE_CODE_WEBFETCH_DEADLINE_MS` to change the deadline, or to `0` to remove the limit

Pass `--json` to `claude plugin install`, `uninstall`, `update`, `enable`, or `disable` to print the result as [one JSON object on the last line of stdout](../08-Plugins-Skills/plugins-cli-reference.md#plugin-json-result)

When the auto mode classifier blocks an action, the reason Claude receives [usually names the rule that matched](auto-mode-config.md#fix-a-denial-with-an-allow-rule-an-environment-entry-or-a-retry), such as `[Data Exfiltration]`

When you type `/` partway through a prompt, you can now pick from [a list of matching commands](interactive-mode.md#complete-a-command-mid-prompt) instead of a single suggestion. The list opens as you type in fullscreen rendering. A plugin skill also matches on its name without the plugin prefix

In the VS Code extension, click the agent count at the bottom of the prompt box to open the [agent map](../03-IDE-Integrations/vs-code.md#use-the-prompt-box), where you can open a subagent’s read-only transcript or stop it

In the VS Code extension, select **Hooks** or **Permissions** in the command menu’s Customize section to [add or remove hooks and permission rules](../03-IDE-Integrations/vs-code.md#use-the-prompt-box) in your user, project, and local settings

Claude can pick a [browser-tab icon](artifacts.md#create-an-artifact) to match each artifact it publishes

In Claude Code on the web, take back a queued message in a cloud session before Claude reads it: remove it from the queue, or press `Esc` or `Up`, and the text returns to the message box
