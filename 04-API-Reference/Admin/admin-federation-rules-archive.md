# Archive Federation Rule

POST/v1/organizations/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/archive

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](../Other/manage-claude-wif-admin-api.md).

Archive a federation rule.

Token exchange through this rule stops immediately. Idempotent; re-archiving returns the rule with its original `archived_at`. Archiving clears the rule's workspace targeting (`workspace_id` and `workspace_ids` are emptied). Tokens already minted before archive remain valid until they expire. OAuth callers may only manage rules whose `oauth_scope` is `workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference`; other scopes require a Console session.

##### Path parameters

federation_rule_id: string



ID of the federation rule to archive.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string



Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

##### Returns



FederationRule object{ id, applies_to_all_workspaces, archived_at, 17 more }



Authorization rule binding an external OIDC identity to Anthropic.

Evaluates the match conditions and mints an OAuth access token for the resolved target, scoped to a single workspace where the rule is enabled (chosen by the caller at exchange time when the rule is enabled for more than one). For rules enabled via `workspace_ids` or `applies_to_all_workspaces`, the target service account must be a member of that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace); rules carrying only the legacy `workspace_id` binding do not enforce this.
