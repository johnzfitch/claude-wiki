# List Service Accounts

GET/v1/organizations/service_accounts

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](../Other/manage-claude-wif-admin-api.md).

List service accounts in the caller's organization.

Results are ordered by creation time, newest first. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate; set `include_archived=true` to include archived service accounts.

##### Query parameters



include_archived: optional boolean



Include archived resources. Defaults to false.

defaultfalse



limit: optional number



Number of results per page.

default20

maximum100

minimum1

page: optional string



Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string



Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.
