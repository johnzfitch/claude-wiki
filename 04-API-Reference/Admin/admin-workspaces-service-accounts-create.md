# Create Service Account Workspace Member

POST/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](../Other/manage-claude-wif-admin-api.md).

Add a service account to a workspace with the given `workspace_role`.

The role determines what the service account can do in the workspace and which workspace-scoped permissions it can be granted when authenticating through federation. Every service account is already an implicit `workspace_user` member of the default workspace; adding it explicitly assigns a chosen role. If the service account is already an explicit member of the workspace, its `workspace_role` is replaced with the value supplied here. Archived workspaces return 400. Archived service accounts cannot be added and are rejected.

##### Path parameters

workspace_id: string



ID of the workspace.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string



Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

##### Body

service_account_id: string



Tagged service account ID to add.



workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_developer" or "workspace_restricted_developer" or "workspace_user"



Role to assign to the service account in this workspace.

One of the following:

"workspace_admin"

##### Returns

created_by_actor_id: string or null



Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

implicit: boolean or null



True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

service_account_id: string

Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).



type: "service_account_workspace_member"



defaultservice_account_workspace_member
