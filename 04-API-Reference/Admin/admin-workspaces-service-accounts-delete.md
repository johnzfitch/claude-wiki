# Delete Service Account Workspace Member

DELETE/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](../Other/manage-claude-wif-admin-api.md).

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Removal is idempotent (returns 200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return 400.

##### Path parameters

workspace_id: string



ID of the workspace.

service_account_id: string



ID of the service account.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string



Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

##### Returns

service_account_id: string



Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`) named in the delete request. Removal is idempotent; see the endpoint description for the implicit-membership no-op.



type: "service_account_workspace_member_deleted"



defaultservice_account_workspace_member_deleted

workspace_id: string



Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`) named in the delete request.
