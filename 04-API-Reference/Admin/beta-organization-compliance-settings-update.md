# Update Compliance Settings

POST/v1/organizations/compliance_settings

Update your organization's Compliance Settings.

Setting `state` to `enabled` turns on the Compliance API and begins capturing organization activity events. Setting it to `disabled` turns both off. `state` reflects whether the Compliance API is enabled.

A request that sets `state` to its current value succeeds and leaves the resource unchanged. A `disabled` request stays in effect until a later `enabled` request or the organization's next provisioning action that enables Access Transparency: enabling Access Transparency also enables the Compliance API, which serves its activity events, so such provisioning (including re-runs) re-enables the Compliance API even after a `disabled` request. Automated provisioning never disables compliance settings.

##### Body



state: [BetaComplianceSettingsStateParam](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/beta/organization/compliance_settings#beta_compliance_settings_state_param)



Desired state. Accepts the string shorthand "enabled" or "disabled" in place of the object form; the response always returns the canonical object form.
