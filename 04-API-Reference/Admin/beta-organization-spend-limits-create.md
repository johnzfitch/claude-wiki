# Set Spend Limit

POST/v1/organizations/spend_limits

Set a spend limit.

Upsert keyed on (scope, period): setting a limit that already exists overwrites it in place. A Claude Enterprise organization sets `user` limits. Its seat-tier, group, and organization-level defaults are configured in claude.ai. A Claude Console organization sets `organization` and `workspace` limits, which are monthly and always carry an amount. Setting those limits is in an early access preview. To request access, contact your Anthropic account team.

##### Body

amount: string or null



Limit amount as a non-negative integer decimal string in the minor unit of the organization's billing currency (cents for USD): "50000" is \$500.00. `null` sets an explicit no-limit override for this scope and `period` only — each period resolves independently, so caps for other periods still apply.



scope: User or Organization or Workspace



What the limit applies to. Claude Enterprise organizations set `user` limits. Claude Console organizations set `organization` and `workspace` limits. Any other combination returns 400. Setting `organization` and `workspace` limits through the API is in an early access preview. To request access, contact your Anthropic account team.

One of the following:



User object{ type: "user", user_id }



Scope selecting a single member of the organization.



type: "user"



Scope type. Always `user` for this scope.

defaultuser

user_id: string



Tagged ID of the member the spend limit applies to.



Organization object{ type: "organization" }





type: "organization"



defaultorganization



Workspace object{ type: "workspace", workspace_id }



Scope selecting one workspace of a Claude Console organization.



type: "workspace"



Scope type. Always `workspace` for this scope.

defaultworkspace

workspace_id: string



Tagged ID of the workspace the spend limit applies to.



period: optional "daily" or "monthly" or "weekly"



One of the following:

"daily"



"monthly"



"weekly"



##### Returns



BetaSpendLimit object{ type: "spend_limit", id, amount, 5 more }



A configured spend limit: a cap on metered spend for one scope and period.
