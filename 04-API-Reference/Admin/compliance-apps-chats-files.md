# Files

##### [Get file metadata](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/compliance/apps/chats/files/retrieve)

GET/v1/compliance/apps/chats/files/{claude_file_id}

Retrieves metadata for a file referenced in chat messages, without downloading the file content. Use the sibling `/content` endpoint to download the bytes.

##### [Delete file](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/compliance/apps/chats/files/delete)

DELETE/v1/compliance/apps/chats/files/{claude_file_id}

Permanently deletes a specific file. This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.

##### [Download file content](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/compliance/apps/chats/files/download)

GET/v1/compliance/apps/chats/files/{claude_file_id}/content

Downloads the binary content of a file referenced in chat messages.

##### Models



FileRetrieveResponse object{ id, claude_chat_ids, created_at, 5 more }



File metadata for GET /v1/compliance/apps/chats/files/{claude_file_id}.

Returns metadata only. Use the sibling `/content` endpoint to download the file bytes.



MIME type of the file's preferred downloadable variant (e.g. 'application/pdf'). May be null for files with no downloadable content (e.g. code-interpreter outputs).
