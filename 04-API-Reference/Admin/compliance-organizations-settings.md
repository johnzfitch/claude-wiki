

The resolved settings in force for one organization at read time.

Settings appear at most once each, in a fixed relative order, and values reflect the enforced state. A setting the organization's administrators cannot change — for example, one controlled by Anthropic policy or not available to the organization — is omitted from the list. Settings that report a compliance arrangement with Anthropic are the exception: the HIPAA and Access Transparency settings are always included; the API zero data retention setting is reported for Claude Console organizations, and the Claude Code zero data retention and customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) settings for Claude Enterprise organizations. Each reports whether the arrangement is in place at the organization level; a retention setting on an individual workspace is not reflected.
