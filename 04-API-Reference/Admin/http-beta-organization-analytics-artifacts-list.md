GET/v1/organizations/analytics/artifacts

Get artifact-creation activity for a given day, broken out by MIME type.

Returns the full (`artifact_type`, `is_shared`) cube for the organization; `next_page` is null except for grouped queries, which paginate. The cube can be broken out per product, per member, or per RBAC group via `group_by[]`, and scoped via `filter[]`. Requires an API key with the `read:analytics` scope.

##### Query parameters



date: string



UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format. The day to get artifact activity for. Data is typically available with a 1-day lag (varies by query; the error for a too-recent date names the latest available day) and may be revised by a few percent over the following days. No earlier than 2026-01-01.

formatdate



filter: optional array of string



Filters as `dimension:value`, e.g. `filter[]=rbac_group_id:{id}`. Repeat the param for OR within a dimension and across dimensions for AND. Supported dimensions on this endpoint: `artifact_type`, `is_shared`, `product`, `rbac_group_id`, `user_id`. Value forms: `artifact_type` is a canonical artifact MIME type (e.g. `text/markdown`) or `other`; `is_shared` is `true` or `false`; `product` is `chat_cowork_unified`, `chat`, `claude_code`, or `cowork` (the surfaces that create artifacts); `rbac_group_id` takes the tagged id (`rbac_group_...`, as emitted in responses and by the spend-limits API) or a bare group UUID, and matches users who held the group at any point during each covered UTC day (time-of-usage attribution); `user_id` takes a tagged user id (`user_...`), as emitted in responses. An unsupported dimension returns 400. At most 100 entries. `chat_cowork_unified` is accepted as a `product` value only on deployments that offer Chat and Cowork unified.

maxItems100



group_by: optional array of "product" or "rbac_group_id" or "user_id"



Dimensions to break results out by: `product`, `user_id` and/or `rbac_group_id`. The ungrouped artifact-type cube is finite and returned in full; grouped queries multiply the cube and paginate via `next_page`. `product` takes the values `chat_cowork_unified`, `chat`, `claude_code`, or `cowork` (the surfaces that create artifacts). `rbac_group_id` attributes a user to every group they held at any point during the requested UTC day, so grouped rows are not an exclusive partition. At most 100 entries.

maxItems100

One of the following:

"product"



"rbac_group_id"



"user_id"





limit: optional number



Maximum rows to return (1-1000, default 100). The ungrouped artifact-type cube is finite and returned in full; `limit` is the page size only when `group_by[]` multiplies the cube.

minimum1

maximum1000

page: optional string



Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page` field. Only valid with `group_by[]` — the ungrouped cube is never paginated.

##### Headers



"anthropic-version": optional string



The version of the Claude API you want to use.

Read more about versioning and our version history [here](../Endpoints/versioning.md).

##### Returns



data: array of [BetaAnalyticsArtifactActivity](platform-claude-com-http-beta-organization-analytics.md#beta_analytics_artifact_activity) { artifact_type, artifacts_created_count, distinct_user_count, 6 more }



artifact_type: string



Canonical artifact MIME type (e.g. `text/markdown`, `application/vnd.ant.react`, `image/svg+xml`), or `other`. Claude Code and Cowork artifacts report as `text/html`.

artifacts_created_count: number



Number of artifacts created in this bucket on the requested day

distinct_user_count: number



Number of distinct users who created artifacts in this bucket on the requested day

is_shared: boolean



Whether the artifacts in this bucket have ever been shared (a Claude Code / Cowork artifact is shared once anyone beyond its creator may open it: named members, the whole organization, or anyone with the link).

published_artifacts_created_count: number



Number of those artifacts that have been published (for Claude Code / Cowork artifacts: open to anyone with the link); never exceeds `artifacts_created_count`

product: optional string or null



Product that produced this row's activity: one of `chat`, `claude_code`, `cowork`, `office_agent`, or `chat_cowork_unified` (Chat and Cowork unified). These are the canonical Cost & Usage product names; an `office_agent` row's per-surface breakdown is in its `office_metrics`. On `/plugins` only `cowork`, `claude_code` and `chat_cowork_unified` occur (the only surfaces with plugin attribution); on `/artifacts` only `chat`, `claude_code`, `cowork` and `chat_cowork_unified` occur (the surfaces that create artifacts); `/apps/chat/projects` does not support the product dimension (a `product` entry in `group_by[]` or `filter[]` there is rejected). Present only when the request grouped by `product`.

rbac_group_id: optional string or null



Tagged RBAC group identifier (`rbac_group_...`), matching the spend-limits API spelling. Present only when the request grouped by `rbac_group_id`.

rbac_group_name: optional string or null



Resolved RBAC group display name, alongside `rbac_group_id` when name resolution is available. Null if the group has been deleted or its name could not be resolved; `rbac_group_id` remains the stable key.

user_id: optional string or null



Tagged user identifier (e.g. `user_...`). Present only when the request grouped by `user_id`.

next_page: string or null



Cursor for the next page of a grouped query; always null for the ungrouped artifact-type cube, which is returned in full.
