This tutorial shows you how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation. You'll learn how to enable Skills, make a request, and access the generated file.

## Prerequisites

- A [Claude API key](../Other/usage-limits.md) or a logged-in [ant CLI](../Other/cli-sdks-libraries-cli-authentication.md)
- A [client SDK](../Other/cli-sdks-libraries-overview.md) for your language, or `curl` and `jq`
- Basic familiarity with making API requests

## Agent Skills overview

Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks such as creating documents, analyzing data, and processing files. Anthropic provides the following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:

- **PowerPoint (pptx):** Create and edit presentations
- **Excel (xlsx):** Create and analyze spreadsheets
- **Word (docx):** Create and edit documents
- **PDF (pdf):** Generate PDF documents



To create custom Skills, see the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/skills-notebooks-01-skills-introduction) for examples of building your own Skills with domain-specific expertise.

## Step 1: List available Skills

First, check what Skills are available. Use the Skills API to list all Anthropic-managed Skills. Each language tab is an excerpt from one continuous script, with any imports and client setup at the top:

cURL

CLI

Python

TypeScript

C#

Go

Java

PHP

Ruby



```python
# List Anthropic-managed Skills
skills = client.skills.list(source="anthropic")

for skill in skills.data:
    print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_name}")
```

You see the following Skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.

This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this metadata at startup to determine which Skills are available. This is the first level of **progressive disclosure**, where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions yet.

## Step 2: Create a presentation

Use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy. Specify Skills using the `container` parameter in the Messages API:

cURL

CLI

Python

TypeScript

C#

Go

Java

PHP

Ruby



```python
# Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-5-5",
    max_tokens=16000,
    container={
        "skills": [{"type": "anthropic", "skill_id": "pptx", "version": "latest"}]
    },
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides",
        }
    ],
    tools=[{"type": "code_execution_20260521", "name": "code_execution"}],
)

print(f"stop_reason={response.stop_reason}, blocks={len(response.content)}")
```

The request includes the following parts:

- **`model`:** A [model that supports the code execution tool](agents-and-tools-tool-use-code-execution-tool.md#compatibility)
- **`container.skills`:** Specifies which Skills Claude can use
- **`type: "anthropic"`:** Indicates this is an Anthropic-managed Skill
- **`skill_id: "pptx"`:** The PowerPoint Skill identifier
- **`version: "latest"`:** The Skill version set to the most recently published
- **`tools`:** Enables code execution (required for Skills)



The examples use the `code_execution_20260521` tool version, and the Step 3 code parses the result types that current tool versions return. Skills also work with older [code execution tool](agents-and-tools-tool-use-code-execution-tool.md) versions such as `code_execution_20250825`: any current code execution tool version satisfies the Skills requirement. If you use a different version, use the tool `type` listed on the code execution tool page.

When you make this request, Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant Skill. Because you asked for a presentation, Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then Claude runs the Skill's code to create your presentation.

## Step 3: Download the created file

The presentation was created in the code execution container and saved as a file. The Step 2 `response` includes a file reference with a file ID. Extract the file ID and download the file with the Files API. The example saves it to your system temp directory:

cURL

CLI

Python

TypeScript

C#

Go

Java

PHP

Ruby



```python
# Extract the file ID. The code execution tool runs the Skill's code through
# its Bash sub-tool, and generated files appear as bash_code_execution_output
# items inside the bash_code_execution_tool_result block.
file_id = None
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "bash_code_execution_tool_result":
        if block.content.type == "bash_code_execution_result":
            for output in block.content.content:
                file_id = output.file_id

if file_id:
    # Download the file and save it
    output_path = Path(tempfile.gettempdir()) / "renewable_energy.pptx"
    file_content = client.files.download(file_id=file_id)
    file_content.write_to_file(output_path)
    print(f"Presentation saved to {output_path}")
```
