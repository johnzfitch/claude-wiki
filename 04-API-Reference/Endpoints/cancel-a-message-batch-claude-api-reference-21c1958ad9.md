# Cancel a Message Batch

[BetaMessageBatch](/docs/en/api/beta#beta_message_batch) Beta.Messages.Batches.Cancel(BatchCancelParamsparameters, CancellationTokencancellationToken = default)

POST/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/cancel

Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

required string ID

Unique object identifier.

The format and length of IDs may change over time.

required DateTimeOffset? ArchivedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived and its results became unavailable.

required DateTimeOffset? CancelInitiatedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated for the Message Batch. Specified only if cancellation was initiated.

required DateTimeOffset CreatedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

required DateTimeOffset? EndedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended. Specified only once processing ends.

Processing ends when every request in a Message Batch has either succeeded, errored, canceled, or expired.

formatdate-time

required DateTimeOffset ExpiresAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch will expire and end processing, which is 24 hours after creation.

"in_progress"InProgress

"canceling"Canceling

"ended"Ended

required [BetaMessageBatchRequestCounts](/docs/en/api/beta#beta_message_batch_request_counts) RequestCounts

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

required Long Canceled

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have been canceled.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

required Long Errored

Number of requests in the Message Batch that encountered an error.

Number of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.

required Long Succeeded

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

required string? ResultsUrl

JsonElement Type "message_batch"constant

Object type.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.
