string

StopReason string

The reason that we stopped.

This may be one the following values:

- `"stop_sequence"`: we reached a stop sequence — either provided by you via the `stop_sequences` parameter, or a stop sequence built into the model
- `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded `max_tokens_to_sample` or the model's maximum

Type Completion

Object type.

For Text Completions, this is always `"completion"`.
