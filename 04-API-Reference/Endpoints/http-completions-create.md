# Create a Text Completion

POST/v1/complete

\[Legacy\] Create a Text Completion.

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. We recommend using the [Messages API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/completions/api-messages-2dd213ca95.md) going forward.

Future models and features will not be compatible with Text Completions. See our [migration guide](../Guides/build-with-claude-working-with-messages.md) for guidance in migrating from Text Completions to Messages.

##### Headers



"anthropic-workspace-id": optional string



Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).

Only needed for credentials that can act on more than one Workspace. A credential that belongs to a specific Workspace may omit it; if sent, it must match that Workspace.



"anthropic-beta": optional array of [AnthropicBeta](http-beta.md#anthropic_beta)⁠Deprecated



Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

Deprecated. This parameter has no effect on this method and will be removed in a future release.

##### Body



max_tokens_to_sample: number



The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

Note that our models may stop *before* reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

minimum1



model: [Model](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/messages#model)



The model that will complete your prompt.

See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

One of the following:



prompt: string



The prompt that you want Claude to complete.

For proper response generation you will need to format your prompt using alternating \`

Human:`and`

Assistant:\` conversational turns. For example:

    "

    Human: {userQuestion}

    Assistant:"

See [prompt validation](../Guides/build-with-claude-working-with-messages.md) and our guide to [prompt design](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/10-Prompting-Guides/build-with-claude-prompt-engineering-overview-1ab62e934b.md) for more details.

minLength1



metadata: optional [Metadata](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/messages#metadata) { user_id }



An object describing metadata about the request.



user_id: optional string or null



An external identifier for the user who is associated with the request.

This should be a uuid, hash value, or other opaque identifier. Anthropic may use this id to help detect abuse. Do not include any identifying information such as name, email address, or phone number.

maxLength512



stop_sequences: optional array of string



Sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

Our models stop on \`"

Human:"\`, and may include additional built-in stop sequences in the future. By providing the stop_sequences parameter, you may include additional strings that will cause the model to stop generating.



stream: optional boolean



Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

See [streaming](../Guides/build-with-claude-streaming.md) for details.



temperature: optional number⁠Deprecated



Amount of randomness injected into the response.

Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting temperature. A value of 1.0 will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

minimum0

maximum1



top_k: optional number⁠Deprecated



Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not accept top_k; any value will be rejected with a 400 error.

Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

Recommended for advanced use cases only.

minimum0



top_p: optional number⁠Deprecated



Use nucleus sampling.

Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting top_p. A value \>= 0.99 will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`.

Recommended for advanced use cases only.

maximum1

##### Returns



Completion object{ type: "completion", id, completion, 2 more }





type: "completion"



Object type.

For Text Completions, this is always `"completion"`.

defaultcompletion



id: string



Unique object identifier.

The format and length of IDs may change over time.

completion: string



The resulting completion up to and excluding the stop sequences.



model: [Model](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/messages#model)



The model that will complete your prompt.

See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

One of the following:



stop_reason: string or null



The reason that we stopped.

This may be one the following values:

- `"stop_sequence"`: we reached a stop sequence — either provided by you via the `stop_sequences` parameter, or a stop sequence built into the model
- `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded `max_tokens_to_sample` or the model's maximum
