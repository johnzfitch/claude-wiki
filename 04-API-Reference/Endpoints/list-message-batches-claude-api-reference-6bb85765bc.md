This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Number of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.

succeeded: Integer

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

results_url: String

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.
