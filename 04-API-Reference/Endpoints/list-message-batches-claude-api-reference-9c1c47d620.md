RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

formatdate-time

ProcessingStatus MessageBatchProcessingStatus

Processing status of the Message Batch.

Accepts one of the following:

const MessageBatchProcessingStatusInProgress MessageBatchProcessingStatus = "in_progress"

const MessageBatchProcessingStatusCanceling MessageBatchProcessingStatus = "canceling"

const MessageBatchProcessingStatusEnded MessageBatchProcessingStatus = "ended"

RequestCounts [MessageBatchRequestCounts](/docs/en/api/messages#message_batch_request_counts)

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

Canceled int64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have been canceled.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Errored int64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that encountered an error.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Expired int64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have expired.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

Processing int64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.

Succeeded int64

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

ResultsURL string

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

Accepts one of the following:
