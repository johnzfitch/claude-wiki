GET/v1/organizations/federation_rules

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](../Other/manage-claude-wif-admin-api.md).

List federation rules in your organization.

Optionally filter by issuer with `issuer_id`. Archived rules are excluded unless `include_archived=true`.

##### Query parameters



include_archived: optional boolean



Include archived resources. Defaults to false.

defaultfalse

issuer_id: optional string



Filter to rules referencing this federation issuer.



limit: optional number



Number of results per page.

default20

minimum1

maximum100

page: optional string



Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

##### Headers



"anthropic-version": optional string



The version of the Claude API you want to use.

Read more about versioning and our version history [here](versioning.md).

##### Returns



data: array of [FederationRule](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/organization/federation/rules#federation_rule) { type: "federation_rule", id, applies_to_all_workspaces, 17 more }





type: "federation_rule"



defaultfederation_rule

id: string



Tagged ID of the federation rule.

applies_to_all_workspaces: boolean



When true, this rule is enabled for every workspace in the org (including ones created after the rule). `workspace_ids` is ignored at exchange time.



archived_at: string or null



If set, this rule is archived and rejects token exchange.

formatdate-time

archived_by_actor_id: string or null



Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this rule.

attributes: map\[string\] or null



CEL expressions extracting named values from claims. Not yet supported; always null.



created_at: string



When this rule was created.

formatdate-time

created_by_actor_id: string or null



Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this rule.

description: string or null



Optional free-text description.

issuer_id: string



Tagged ID of the issuer whose tokens this rule accepts.

issuer_name: string or null



Issuer's display name at read time.



match: [FederationRuleMatch](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/organization/federation/rules#federation_rule_match) { audience, claims, condition, subject_prefix }



Conditions the verified JWT must satisfy for this rule to apply. All populated matcher fields must pass.



audience: optional string or null



Exact match against the `aud` claim (any element if array). When omitted, the JWT's `aud` must still equal Anthropic's expected audience for the issuer; setting this field overrides that default.

maxLength1024

claims: optional map\[string\] or null



Exact-match `{claim: value}` pairs against top-level claims. Only string-valued claims can be matched; use `condition` for non-string claims.



condition: optional string or null



CEL expression over claims for logic the structural fields can't express. Must evaluate to a boolean and may reference only the `claims` variable; a constant-true expression (such as `true`) is rejected with 400.

maxLength4096



subject_prefix: optional string or null



Match the verified JWT `sub` claim. Exact match unless the value ends with `*`, in which case it is a prefix match. Example: `repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main`.

maxLength1024

name: string



Admin-chosen slug identifier.

oauth_scope: string



Space-separated OAuth scopes granted on the minted token.



target: [ServiceAccountTarget](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/http/organization/federation/rules#service_account_target) { type: "service_account", service_account_id, service_account_name }



What this rule targets. Check `type` before reading the other fields. Tokens minted via a rule whose target `type` is `service_account` act as that service account.

type: "service_account"



service_account_id: string



Tagged ID of the service account to mint tokens for.

service_account_name: optional string or null



Service account's display name at read time. Ignored on writes.

token_lifetime_seconds: number



Lifetime in seconds of access tokens minted via this rule. Minted tokens are capped at `max(60, min(this value, 2 × remaining assertion validity))` seconds.



updated_at: string



When this rule was last updated.

formatdate-time

updated_by_actor_id: string or null



Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this rule.

workspace_id: string or null



Legacy single-workspace binding. Prefer `workspace_ids` and the `/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/workspaces` sub-resource for managing workspace enablement.

workspace_ids: array of string



Tagged IDs of the workspaces this rule is enabled for. May be empty for older rules that only carry the legacy `workspace_id` binding. Ignored at exchange time when `applies_to_all_workspaces` is true (the list may still be non-empty).

next_page: string or null



Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.
