# Remove Workspace From Service Account

DELETE/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](../Other/manage-claude-wif-admin-api.md).

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Mirror of `DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`, addressed from the service-account side. Removal is idempotent (returns 200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return 400.

##### Path parameters

service_account_id: string



ID of the service account.

workspace_id: string



ID of the workspace.

##### Returns



type: "service_account_workspace_member_deleted"



defaultservice_account_workspace_member_deleted

service_account_id: string



Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`) named in the delete request. Removal is idempotent; see the endpoint description for the implicit-membership no-op.

workspace_id: string



Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`) named in the delete request.
