# Retrieve a Message Batch

messages.batches.retrieve(strmessage_batch_id) -\> [MessageBatch](/docs/en/api/messages#message_batch)

get/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}

This endpoint is idempotent and can be used to poll for Message Batch completion. To access the results of a Message Batch, make a request to the `results_url` field in the response.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

"in_progress"

"canceling"

"ended"

request_counts: [MessageBatchRequestCounts](/docs/en/api/messages#message_batch_request_counts)

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.
