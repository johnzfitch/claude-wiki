# Create Federation Rule

POST/v1/organizations/federation_rules

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api).

Create a federation rule owned by your organization.

The referenced issuer and the target service account must already exist in the same organization; invalid references are rejected with a 400 error. The workspace reference is validated. Membership is not checked at rule creation: token exchange resolves a single enabled workspace per call and is rejected unless the target service account is a member of that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace). Rules on well-known shared issuers (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Buildkite, Terraform Cloud, Google) must constrain tenant identity via an identity-bearing claim, a tenant-pinning subject prefix (such as `repo:YOUR_ORG/...`), or a CEL condition referencing one of those identity claims (e.g. `claims.repository_owner`). OAuth callers may only manage rules whose `oauth_scope` is `workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference`; other scopes require a Console session.

##### Body

issuer_id: string



Tagged ID of the federation issuer.



match: [BetaFederationRuleMatch](/docs/en/api/http/beta/organization/federation/rules#beta_federation_rule_match) { audience, claims, condition, subject_prefix }



Conditions the verified JWT must satisfy for this rule to apply. At least one of `subject_prefix` (other than a wildcard-only value like `*`), `claims`, or `condition` is required; `audience` alone is not sufficient.



audience: optional string or null



Exact match against the `aud` claim (any element if array). When omitted, the JWT's `aud` must still equal Anthropic's expected audience for the issuer; setting this field overrides that default.

maxLength1024

claims: optional map\[string\] or null



Exact-match `{claim: value}` pairs against top-level claims. Only string-valued claims can be matched; use `condition` for non-string claims.



condition: optional string or null



CEL expression over claims for logic the structural fields can't express. Must evaluate to a boolean and may reference only the `claims` variable; a constant-true expression (such as `true`) is rejected with 400.

maxLength4096



subject_prefix: optional string or null



Match the verified JWT `sub` claim. Exact match unless the value ends with `*`, in which case it is a prefix match. Example: `repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main`.

maxLength1024



name: string



Slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

minLength1

maxLength255



oauth_scope: string



Space-separated OAuth scopes. OAuth callers may only set `workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference`; other scopes (such as `org:admin`) require a Console session.

minLength1



target: [BetaServiceAccountTarget](/docs/en/api/http/beta/organization/federation/rules#beta_service_account_target) { type: "service_account", service_account_id, service_account_name }



Identity that tokens minted via this rule act as. Currently always a `service_account` target.

type: "service_account"



service_account_id: string



Tagged ID of the service account to mint tokens for.

service_account_name: optional string or null



Service account's display name at read time. Ignored on writes.

applies_to_all_workspaces: optional boolean



When true, enable this rule for every workspace in the org (including workspaces created later).

attributes: optional map\[string\] or null



CEL expressions `{name: expr}` extracting named values from claims. Not yet supported; any non-empty value is rejected with 400.



description: optional string or null



Optional free-text description.

maxLength2000



token_lifetime_seconds: optional number



Lifetime in seconds for access tokens minted via this rule (60-86400). Defaults to 3600 (1h). Minted tokens are capped at `max(60, min(this value, 2 × remaining assertion validity))` seconds.

minimum60

maximum86400

workspace_id: optional string or null



Tagged ID of the workspace to enable this rule for. Required unless `applies_to_all_workspaces` is true. Additional workspaces can be added via the `/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/workspaces` sub-resource.

##### Returns



BetaFederationRule object{ type: "federation_rule", id, applies_to_all_workspaces, 17 more }



Authorization rule binding an external OIDC identity to Anthropic.

Evaluates the match conditions and mints an OAuth access token for the resolved target, scoped to a single workspace where the rule is enabled (chosen by the caller at exchange time when the rule is enabled for more than one). For rules enabled via `workspace_ids` or `applies_to_all_workspaces`, the target service account must be a member of that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace); rules carrying only the legacy `workspace_id` binding do not enforce this.
