Messages/First steps

# Get your Claude API key




Find, create, and manage your API keys for the Claude API in the Claude Console.




API keys for the Claude API (also called Anthropic API keys) live in the Claude Console. To view your existing keys or create a new one, go to [Settings → API keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys).




Create an API key

1.  1

    Sign in to the Claude Console

    Go to [platform.claude.com](https://platform.claude.com/) and sign in, or create an account if you don't have one yet.

2.  2

    Open the API keys page

    Go to [Settings → API keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys).

3.  3

    Create a key

    Click **Create key**, then give the key a name. You can also choose a [workspace](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces) to scope the key to, and an expiration.

4.  4

    Copy and store the key

    The Console shows the full key, which starts with `sk-ant-`, only once, at creation. Copy it and store it somewhere safe, such as a secrets manager. If you lose a key, you can't view it again in the Console. Create a new key instead.

If the **Create key** button is disabled, you may not have permission to create keys in that workspace. Ask an organization admin to grant you access or to create a key for you.




Use your API key

Set the key as an environment variable:

```python
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."
```



The [client SDKs](/docs/en/cli-sdks-libraries/overview) read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` automatically. Direct HTTP requests send the key in the `x-api-key` header. To make your first request, follow the [Quickstart](/docs/en/get-started), and see [Authentication](/docs/en/manage-claude/authentication) for the full picture, including short-lived credentials with Workload Identity Federation.




API keys and the Admin API

The [Admin API](/docs/en/api/admin) includes endpoints for managing your organization's API keys programmatically, such as [Retrieve API Key](/docs/en/api/admin/api_keys/retrieve) and [List API Keys](/docs/en/api/admin/api_keys/list). These endpoints are for organization admins automating key management. They require a separate [Admin API key](/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api-keys), and they never return a key's secret value, only a partially redacted hint.



The Admin API can't recover a lost key or give you a key to call the Claude API with. To get a usable API key, create one in [Settings → API keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys) in the Claude Console.
