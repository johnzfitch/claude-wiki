To use the Claude API and Workbench, add usage credits to your organization's balance. You’ll need to fill out some additional information about your organization and use case. Then, you’ll enter your payment details and fund your account.

 

Once you’ve purchased usage credits for your account, you’re ready to use the API in your commercial application. You can find more information on prepaid billing and credits here.

 

If you need custom rate limits, monthly invoicing, or hands-on support, contact us for further information.
