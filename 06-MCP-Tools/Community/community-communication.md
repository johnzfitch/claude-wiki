All communication is governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect respectful, professional, and inclusive interactions across all channels.


[​](#discord)

Discord

The [MCP Contributor Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) is for real-time contributor discussion and collaboration. The server is designed for **MCP contributors** and is not intended for general MCP support.


[​](#public-channels-default)

Public Channels (Default)

**Purpose:** Open community engagement, collaborative development, and transparent project coordination. **Primary use cases:**

- SDK and tooling development (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`, `#inspector-dev`)
- [Working Group and Interest Group](community-working-interest-groups.md) discussions (e.g., `#auth-wg`, `#security-ig`)
- Community onboarding and contribution guidance
- Community feedback and collaborative brainstorming
- Public office hours and maintainer availability

**Avoid:**

- MCP user support - Read official documentation and use GitHub Discussions for questions
- Service or product marketing - Keep discussions vendor-neutral; mentions of brands are discouraged except as examples relevant to the specification


[​](#private-channels-exceptions)

Private Channels (Exceptions)

**Purpose:** Confidential coordination and sensitive matters. Access is restricted to designated maintainers. **Criteria for private use:**

- Security incidents (CVEs, protocol vulnerabilities)
- People matters (maintainer discussions, code of conduct issues)
- Coordination requiring immediate or focused response with a limited audience
- Some channels are read-only for maintainer decision-making

**Transparency requirements:**

- All technical and governance decisions affecting the community must be documented in GitHub Discussions and/or Issues, labeled with `notes`
- Private channels are temporary “incident rooms,” not for routine development
- Some matters related to individual contributors may remain private when appropriate

Any significant discussion on Discord that leads to a potential decision or proposal must be moved to GitHub Discussion or Issue for a persistent, searchable record.


[​](#github-discussions)


Use for structured, long-form discussion and debate on project direction. **When to use:**

- Project roadmap planning and milestone discussions
- Announcements and release communications
- Community polls and consensus-building
- Feature requests with context and rationale
- If a repository doesn’t have Discussions enabled, use GitHub Issues instead


[​](#github-issues)


Use for bug reports and actionable development tasks. Feature requests should go to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions). **When to use:**

- Bug reports with reproducible steps
- Documentation improvements with specific scope
- CI/CD problems and infrastructure issues
- Release tasks and milestone tracking

**Note:** SEP proposals are submitted as pull requests to the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/seps), not as GitHub Issues. See the [SEP Guidelines](community-sep-guidelines.md).


[​](#security-issues)

Security Issues

**Do not post security issues publicly.**

1.  Use the private security reporting process in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
2.  Contact Lead or [Core Maintainers](community-governance.md#current-core-maintainers) directly
3.  Follow responsible disclosure guidelines


[​](#decision-records)

Decision Records

All MCP decisions are documented in public channels:

| Type                  | Location                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical decisions   | [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and SEPs |
| Specification changes | [Changelog](../Spec/draft-changelog.md)                    |
| Process changes       | [Community documentation](community-governance.md)               |
| Governance decisions  | [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and SEPs |

When documenting decisions, we retain as much context as possible:

- Decision makers
- Background context and motivation
- Options considered
- Rationale for chosen approach
- Implementation steps
