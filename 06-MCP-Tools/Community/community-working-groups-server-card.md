# Server Card Charter

Copy pageCopy page

Charter for the MCP Server Card Working Group.

Copy pageCopy page


[​](#group-type)

Group Type

**Working Group**


[​](#mission-statement)

Mission Statement

The Server Card Working Group exists to define mechanisms that facilitate discovery and usage of MCP servers via common discovery mechanisms, and to provide guidance on how this fits into broader AI standardization efforts around discovery. Concretely, the WG will define what constitutes an MCP Server Card, the standardized document format a Server Card must follow, and how clients discover a Server Card for a given server.


[​](#scope)

Scope


[​](#in-scope)

In Scope

- **Specification Work**: SEPs or extensions defining what constitutes an MCP Server Card and the specific format of the Server Card document.
- **Discovery Mechanism**: Specification of how an MCP Server Card document is discovered (well-known URL, resource-based discovery, etc.).
- **Cross-Ecosystem Coordination**: A recommendation to the [AI Card](https://github.com/Agent-Card/ai-card) effort on how to interact with MCP Server Cards.
- **Documentation**: Specification sections and guidance covering Server Card authoring and consumption.


[​](#out-of-scope)

Out of Scope

- Changes to the MCP initialization handshake or transport layer.
- A general-purpose MCP server registry or catalog (owned by the Registry WG).
- Internationalization of Server Card content until an MCP-wide i18n approach is defined.


[​](#related-groups)

Related Groups

- **Registry WG** — Server Card format should stay as close as possible to a subset of `server.json`; coordination required to avoid divergence.
- **AI Card effort** (external) — ongoing discussion on whether and how an AI Catalog can link directly to an MCP Server Card.
