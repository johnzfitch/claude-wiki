[​](#abstract)

Abstract

This SEP deprecates the following core protocol features:

- **Roots** (`roots/list`, `notifications/roots/list_changed`)
- **Sampling** (`sampling/createMessage`, `ClientCapabilities.tasks.requests.sampling`)
- **Logging** (`logging/setLevel`, `notifications/message`)

These features are deprecated starting in the specification version that includes this SEP (expected June 2026). They will continue to be fully functional in all specification versions released within one year of that version’s release. Each of those subsequent versions will in turn support the features for one year after its own release, assuming the one-year-per-version support policy proposed in a separate SEP. This provides implementations with an extended migration window before the features are fully removed. During the deprecation period, wire-level behavior is unchanged. No types are removed, no capability negotiation changes, and no existing implementations break. The deprecation serves as a signal to the ecosystem to stop building on these features and to plan for their eventual removal.


[​](#motivation)

Motivation

The MCP specification aims to remain minimal and focused. Features that see low adoption, overlap with existing alternatives, or impose disproportionate implementation burden relative to their value are candidates for removal. Keeping such features in the core specification increases the burden for every client and server, slows protocol evolution, and makes the specification harder to learn. The following three features meet these criteria. Deprecating these features was proposed during a recent core contributor meeting. This SEP formalizes that proposal with a concrete implementation plan. See [discussion \#2536](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/2536).


[​](#roots)

Roots

Roots provides “informational guidance” about which directories or files a server should operate on. In practice:

- **Low adoption**: Few clients implement roots support, and few servers rely on it. The [feature support matrix](../General/clients.md#feature-support-matrix) shows limited client coverage.
- **Vague semantics**: The specification describes roots as informational — servers are not required to respect them, which reduces their utility.
- **Overlapping alternatives**: Working directory context can be provided through tool parameters, resource URIs, server configuration, or environment variables — all of which are more explicit.


[​](#sampling)

Sampling

Sampling allows servers to request LLM completions from the client. While conceptually powerful, it has struggled with adoption:

- **Complex to implement**: Correct sampling implementation requires human-in-the-loop approval, model selection logic, security considerations, and (since SEP-1577) tool loop support. This complexity has contributed to low client adoption.
- **Low adoption**: The [feature support matrix](../General/clients.md#feature-support-matrix) shows that few clients support sampling, despite the feature being available since the November 2024 specification.
- **Direct alternatives**: Servers that need LLM capabilities can integrate directly with LLM provider APIs, giving them full control over model selection, parameters, and streaming.


[​](#logging)

Logging

Logging allows servers to send structured log messages to clients via the protocol:

- **Overlapping infrastructure**: Standard logging mechanisms (stderr for stdio transports, OpenTelemetry for structured observability) are mature, widely adopted, and better suited to logging than an application-protocol channel.
- **Low value relative to complexity**: Adding log message types, severity levels, and the `logging/setLevel` request to the core specification increases the implementation surface for all clients and servers.

[​](#annotation-format)

Annotation format

Each deprecated item SHOULD receive a JSDoc `@deprecated` tag with a brief explanation:

```python
/**
 * Present if the client supports listing roots.
 *
 * @deprecated Deprecated as of this specification version. Will be included
 * in all versions released within one year, then may be removed.
 */
roots?: {
  listChanged?: boolean;
};
```


[​](#union-types)

Union types

The following union types reference deprecated types but MUST NOT be modified during the deprecation period. They will be updated when the deprecated types are removed:

- `ClientNotification` (includes `RootsListChangedNotification`)
- `ClientResult` (includes `CreateMessageResult`, `ListRootsResult`)
- `ServerRequest` (includes `CreateMessageRequest`, `ListRootsRequest`)
- `ServerNotification` (includes `LoggingMessageNotification`)


[​](#documentation-changes)

Documentation changes

Add a deprecation warning block at the top of each feature’s documentation page, after the title: **`docs/specification/draft/client/roots.mdx`:**

```python
<Warning>
**Deprecated**: The Roots feature is deprecated as of this specification
version. It will remain fully functional in all specification versions released
within one year of the <YYYY-MM-DD> release. Each of those versions will
continue to support it for one year after its own release.
</Warning>
```

**`docs/specification/draft/client/sampling.mdx`:**

```python
<Warning>
**Deprecated**: The Sampling feature is deprecated as of this specification
version. It will remain fully functional in all specification versions released
within one year of the <YYYY-MM-DD> release. Each of those versions will
continue to support it for one year after its own release.
</Warning>
```

**`docs/specification/draft/server/utilities/logging.mdx`:**

```python
<Warning>
**Deprecated**: The Logging feature is deprecated as of this specification
version. It will remain fully functional in all specification versions released
within one year of the <YYYY-MM-DD> release. Each of those versions will
continue to support it for one year after its own release.
</Warning>
```


[​](#capability-negotiation)

Capability negotiation

During the deprecation period, capability negotiation is **unchanged**:

- Clients and servers that support deprecated features SHOULD continue to declare the corresponding capabilities.
- Implementations that encounter deprecated capabilities MUST still handle them correctly.
- Implementations SHOULD emit a warning (e.g., in logs or developer tooling) when deprecated capabilities are negotiated.
- New implementations SHOULD NOT add support for deprecated features unless needed for backward compatibility with existing counterparts.


[​](#timeline)

Timeline

- **Deprecated**: In the next specification release (currently planned for June 2026).
- **Included in subsequent releases**: All specification versions released within one year of this version’s release MUST continue to include these features as deprecated.
- **Per-version support**: Each version that includes these features will support them for one year after that version’s release, per the one-year-per-version support policy proposed in a separate SEP.
- **Removal**: Specification versions released more than one year after this version’s release MAY remove these features entirely.


[​](#rationale)

Rationale


[​](#why-deprecate-rather-than-move-to-extensions)

Why deprecate rather than move to extensions?

These features are already implemented in many clients and servers. The extensions mechanism (SEP-2133) specifies that unless an extension is provided, implementations must behave as if the extension is not present. Retrofitting this logic into existing SDKs — especially across multiple protocol versions — would be complex and error-prone. Deprecation followed by removal is less disruptive: implementations can continue using the features as-is during the transition period, then simply stop when the features are removed.


[​](#why-deprecate-rather-than-remove-immediately)

Why deprecate rather than remove immediately?

While adoption of these features is low, they are still in use. Removing them immediately would cause unnecessary churn and disruption for users, client and server owners, and SDK builders. A deprecation window minimizes this impact by giving the ecosystem time to migrate at its own pace.


[​](#why-these-three-features-specifically)

Why these three features specifically?

These were identified during a core contributor meeting as the features with the weakest adoption-to-complexity ratio. Each has viable alternatives outside the protocol, and none are critical to the core resource/tool/prompt interaction model that defines MCP. See [discussion \#2536](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/2536).


[​](#backward-compatibility)

Backward Compatibility

During the deprecation period, there are **no backward compatibility issues**. All deprecated features continue to work identically. No wire-level changes are introduced. After removal (in specification versions released more than one year after this version):

- Implementations negotiating an older protocol version that includes these features will still have access to them through that version’s schema.
- Implementations negotiating a version that has removed these features will no longer have access to them.


[​](#security-implications)

Security Implications

Deprecating these features has a **net positive** effect on security:

- **Sampling** is the most security-sensitive of the three. It allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, which creates attack surface for prompt injection and data exfiltration. Removing it reduces this risk.
- **Roots** exposes information about the client’s filesystem to servers. Removing it reduces the risk of servers using root information to attempt directory traversal or access files outside intended boundaries.
- **Logging** has minimal security implications, but removing it simplifies the protocol surface area.

No new security concerns are introduced by deprecation.


[​](#reference-implementation)

Reference Implementation

No reference implementation is required. This SEP only marks existing functionality as deprecated — no new protocol behavior is introduced.
