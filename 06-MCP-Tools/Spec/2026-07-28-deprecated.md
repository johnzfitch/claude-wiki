# Deprecated Features

This page is the registry of specification features that are currently in the **Deprecated** state under the [feature lifecycle and deprecation policy](../Community/community-feature-lifecycle.md) ([SEP-2596](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2596)). A Deprecated feature remains part of the specification but is scheduled for removal: new implementations **SHOULD NOT** adopt it, and existing implementations **SHOULD** migrate before the feature’s earliest removal. The earliest removal marks when a feature becomes *eligible* for removal; the actual removal is a Core Maintainer decision taken during release preparation and may happen later. This registry is a derived view kept consistent with the per-feature deprecation notices and changelog entries, which are the normative records.

The HTTP+SSE transport and the `includeContext` values were already described as deprecated before the lifecycle policy existed; SEP-2596 reclassifies them as Deprecated under its [transition provisions](../Community/community-feature-lifecycle.md).
