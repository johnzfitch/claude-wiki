Authorization Extensions

# Authorization Extensions

Supplementary authorization mechanisms for the Model Context Protocol

Copy pageCopy page

The [ext-auth repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) contains official MCP extensions that add authorization capabilities beyond the core MCP specification. These extensions address specific real-world scenarios where the standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow isn’t the right fit.

Source code, specifications, and reference implementations for MCP authorization extensions.

Why authorization extensions?

The core MCP specification includes a robust [authorization framework](/specification/latest/basic/authorization) built on OAuth 2.0. That framework handles the common case well: a user interactively grants an MCP client permission to access a server on their behalf. But not every MCP deployment fits this pattern:

- **Machine-to-machine integrations** don’t have a human in the loop. Background services, CI pipelines, and automated workflows need to authenticate without interactive user consent flows.
- **Enterprise environments** often have centralized identity providers (IdPs) that enforce policy across all applications. Requiring employees to authorize each MCP server individually creates friction and bypasses existing security controls.

The ext-auth extensions address these gaps.


[​](#available-extensions)

Available extensions

## OAuth Client Credentials

Machine-to-machine authentication using the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow. No user interaction required.

## Enterprise-Managed Authorization

Centralized access control via enterprise identity providers. Employees access MCP servers through their organization’s IdP.

Choosing the right extension

| Scenario                                             | Recommended extension                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Background service or daemon accessing an MCP server | [OAuth Client Credentials](/extensions/auth/oauth-client-credentials)                 |
| CI/CD pipeline calling MCP tools                     | [OAuth Client Credentials](/extensions/auth/oauth-client-credentials)                 |
| Server-to-server API integration                     | [OAuth Client Credentials](/extensions/auth/oauth-client-credentials)                 |
| Enterprise employees accessing MCP servers at work   | [Enterprise-Managed Authorization](/extensions/auth/enterprise-managed-authorization) |
| Organization-wide MCP access policy enforcement      | [Enterprise-Managed Authorization](/extensions/auth/enterprise-managed-authorization) |
| Standard interactive user authorization              | Core MCP spec (no extension needed)                                                   |


[​](#client-support)

Client support

Authorization extension support varies by client. See the [client matrix](/extensions/client-matrix) for a full breakdown. Both extensions require explicit support from the MCP client — they are never active by default.


[​](#specification)

Specification

Both extensions are specified in the [ext-auth repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth/tree/main/specification/draft). They use the standard MCP [extension negotiation](/extensions/overview#negotiation) mechanism: clients declare support in the `extensions` field of the `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` they send in each request’s `_meta`, and servers advertise theirs in the capabilities returned by [`server/discover`](/specification/draft/server/discover).
