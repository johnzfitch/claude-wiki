# Build an MCP App


Getting started guide for building interactive UI applications with MCP Apps


## 

[​](#prerequisites)

Prerequisites

You’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 18 or higher. Familiarity with [MCP tools](/specification/latest/server/tools) and [resources](/specification/latest/server/resources) is recommended since MCP Apps combine both primitives. Experience with the [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) will help you better understand the server-side patterns.

## 

[​](#getting-started)

Getting started

The fastest way to create an MCP App is using an AI coding agent with the MCP Apps skill. If you prefer to set up a project manually, skip to [Manual setup](#manual-setup).

### 

[​](#using-an-ai-coding-agent)

Using an AI coding agent

AI coding agents with Skills support can scaffold a complete MCP App project for you. Skills are folders of instructions and resources that your agent loads when relevant. They teach the AI how to perform specialized tasks like creating MCP Apps. The `create-mcp-app` skill includes architecture guidance, best practices, and working examples that the agent uses to generate your project.

[](#)

Install the skill

If you are using Claude Code, you can install the skill directly with:

Copy

``` shiki
/plugin marketplace add modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps
/plugin install mcp-apps@modelcontextprotocol-ext-apps
```

You can also use the [Vercel Skills CLI](https://skills.sh/) to install skills across different AI coding agents:

Copy

``` shiki
npx skills add modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps
```

Alternatively, you can install the skill manually by cloning the ext-apps repository:

Copy

``` shiki
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps.git
```

And then copying the skill to the appropriate location for your agent:

| Agent | Skills directory (macOS/Linux) | Skills directory (Windows) |
|----|----|----|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) | `~/.claude/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\` |
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills) and [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills) | `~/.copilot/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\skills\` |
| [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/) | `~/.gemini/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\skills\` |
| [Cline](https://cline.bot/blog/cline-3-48-0-skills-and-websearch-make-cline-smarter) | `~/.cline/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.cline\skills\` |
| [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/context-engineering/using-skills/) | `~/.config/goose/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\goose\skills\` |
| [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) | `~/.codex/skills/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\skills\` |

This list is not comprehensive. Other agents may support skills in different locations; check your agent’s documentation.

For example, with Claude Code you can install the skill globally (available in all projects):

macOS/Linux

Windows

Copy

``` shiki
cp -r ext-apps/plugins/mcp-apps/skills/create-mcp-app ~/.claude/skills/create-mcp-app
```

Or install it for a single project only by copying to `.claude/skills/` in your project directory:

macOS/Linux

Windows

Copy

``` shiki
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -r ext-apps/plugins/mcp-apps/skills/create-mcp-app .claude/skills/create-mcp-app
```

To verify the skill is installed, ask your agent “What skills do you have access to?” — you should see `create-mcp-app` as one of the available skills.

2

[](#)

Create your app

Ask your AI coding agent to build it:

Copy

``` shiki
Create an MCP App that displays a color picker
```

The agent will recognize the `create-mcp-app` skill is relevant, load its instructions, then scaffold a complete project with server, UI, and configuration files.

3

[](#)

Run your app

macOS/Linux

Windows

Copy

``` shiki
npm install && npm run build && npm run serve
```

You might need to make sure that you are first in the **app folder** before running the commands above.

4

[](#)

Test your app

Follow the instructions in [Testing your app](#testing-your-app) below. For the color picker example, start a new chat and ask Claude to provide you a color picker.

### 

[​](#manual-setup)

Manual setup

If you’re not using an AI coding agent, or prefer to understand the setup process, follow these steps.

[](#)

Create the project structure

A typical MCP App project separates the server code from the UI code:

my-mcp-app

package.json

tsconfig.json

vite.config.ts

server.ts

mcp-app.html

src

mcp-app.ts

The server registers the tool and serves the UI resource. The UI resource will eventually be rendered in a secure iframe with deny-by-default CSP configuration. If your app has CSS and JS assets, you will need to [configure CSP](https://apps.extensions.modelcontextprotocol.io/api/documents/Patterns.html#configuring-csp-and-cors), or you can bundle your assets into the HTML with a tool like `vite-plugin-singlefile`, which is what we will do in this tutorial.

2

[](#)

Install dependencies

Copy

``` shiki
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
npm install -D typescript vite vite-plugin-singlefile express cors @types/express @types/cors tsx
```

The `ext-apps` package provides helpers for both the server side (registering tools and resources) and the client side (the `App` class for UI-to-host communication). Vite with the `vite-plugin-singlefile` plugin is used here to bundle your UI and assets into a single HTML file for convenience, but this is optional — you can use any bundler or serve unbundled files if you [configure CSP](https://apps.extensions.modelcontextprotocol.io/api/documents/Patterns.html#configuring-csp-and-cors).

3

[](#)

Configure the project

- package.json

- tsconfig.json

- vite.config.ts

The `"type": "module"` setting enables ES module syntax. The `build` script uses the `INPUT` environment variable to tell Vite which HTML file to bundle. The `serve` script runs your server using `tsx` for TypeScript execution.

Copy

``` shiki
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "INPUT=mcp-app.html vite build",
    "serve": "npx tsx server.ts"
  }
}
```

The TypeScript configuration targets modern JavaScript (`ES2022`) and uses ESNext modules with bundler resolution, which works well with Vite. The `include` array covers both the server code in the root and UI code in `src/`.

Copy

``` shiki
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["*.ts", "src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

Copy

``` shiki
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { viteSingleFile } from "vite-plugin-singlefile";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [viteSingleFile()],
  build: {
    outDir: "dist",
    rollupOptions: {
      input: process.env.INPUT,
    },
  },
});
```

[](#)

Build the project

With the project structure and configuration in place, continue to [Building an MCP App](#building-an-mcp-app) below to implement the server and UI.

## 

[​](#building-an-mcp-app)

Building an MCP App

Let’s build a simple app that displays the current server time. This example demonstrates the full pattern: registering a tool with UI metadata, serving the bundled HTML as a resource, and building a UI that communicates with the server.

### 

[​](#server-implementation)

Server implementation

The server needs to do two things: register a tool that includes the `_meta.ui.resourceUri` field, and register a resource handler that serves the bundled HTML. Here’s the complete server file:

Copy

``` shiki
// server.ts
console.log("Starting MCP App server...");

import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import {
  registerAppTool,
  registerAppResource,
  RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE,
} from "@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/server";
import cors from "cors";
import express from "express";
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "My MCP App Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// The ui:// scheme tells hosts this is an MCP App resource.
// The path structure is arbitrary; organize it however makes sense for your app.
const resourceUri = "ui://get-time/mcp-app.html";

// Register the tool that returns the current time
registerAppTool(
  server,
  "get-time",
  {
    title: "Get Time",
    description: "Returns the current server time.",
    inputSchema: {},
    _meta: { ui: { resourceUri } },
  },
  async () => {
    const time = new Date().toISOString();
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: time }],
    };
  },
);

// Register the resource that serves the bundled HTML
registerAppResource(
  server,
  resourceUri,
  resourceUri,
  { mimeType: RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE },
  async () => {
    const html = await fs.readFile(
      path.join(import.meta.dirname, "dist", "mcp-app.html"),
      "utf-8",
    );
    return {
      contents: [
        { uri: resourceUri, mimeType: RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE, text: html },
      ],
    };
  },
);

// Expose the MCP server over HTTP
const expressApp = express();
expressApp.use(cors());
expressApp.use(express.json());

expressApp.post("/mcp", async (req, res) => {
  const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
    sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
    enableJsonResponse: true,
  });
  res.on("close", () => transport.close());
  await server.connect(transport);
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
});

expressApp.listen(3001, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error starting server:", err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log("Server listening on http://localhost:3001/mcp");
});
```

Let’s break down the key parts:

- **`resourceUri`**: The `ui://` scheme tells hosts this is an MCP App resource. The path structure is arbitrary.
- **`registerAppTool`**: Registers a tool with the `_meta.ui.resourceUri` field. When the host calls this tool, the UI is fetched and rendered, and the tool result is passed to it upon arrival.
- **`registerAppResource`**: Serves the bundled HTML when the host requests the UI resource.
- **Express server**: Exposes the MCP server over HTTP on port 3001.

### 

[​](#ui-implementation)

UI implementation

The UI consists of an HTML page and a TypeScript module that uses the `App` class to communicate with the host. Here’s the HTML:

Copy

``` shiki
<!-- mcp-app.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Get Time App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      <strong>Server Time:</strong>
      <code id="server-time">Loading...</code>
    </p>
    <button id="get-time-btn">Get Server Time</button>
    <script type="module" src="/src/mcp-app.ts"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the TypeScript module:

Copy

``` shiki
// src/mcp-app.ts
import { App } from "@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps";

const serverTimeEl = document.getElementById("server-time")!;
const getTimeBtn = document.getElementById("get-time-btn")!;

const app = new App({ name: "Get Time App", version: "1.0.0" });

// Establish communication with the host
app.connect();

// Handle the initial tool result pushed by the host
app.ontoolresult = (result) => {
  const time = result.content?.find((c) => c.type === "text")?.text;
  serverTimeEl.textContent = time ?? "[ERROR]";
};

// Proactively call tools when users interact with the UI
getTimeBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const result = await app.callServerTool({
    name: "get-time",
    arguments: {},
  });
  const time = result.content?.find((c) => c.type === "text")?.text;
  serverTimeEl.textContent = time ?? "[ERROR]";
});
```

The key parts:

- **`app.connect()`**: Establishes communication with the host. Call this once when your app initializes.
- **`app.ontoolresult`**: A callback that fires when the host pushes a tool result to your app (e.g., when the tool is first called and the UI renders).
- **`app.callServerTool()`**: Lets your app proactively call tools on the server. Keep in mind that each call involves a round-trip to the server, so design your UI to handle latency gracefully.

The `App` class provides additional methods for logging, opening URLs, and updating the model’s context with structured data from your app. See the full [API documentation](https://apps.extensions.modelcontextprotocol.io/api/).

## 

[​](#testing-your-app)

Testing your app

To test your MCP App, build the UI and start your local server:

macOS/Linux

Windows

Copy

``` shiki
npm run build && npm run serve
```

In the default configuration, your server will be available at `http://localhost:3001/mcp`. However, to see your app render, you need an MCP host that supports MCP Apps. You have several options.

### 

[​](#testing-with-claude)

Testing with Claude

[Claude](https://claude.ai) (web) and [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) support MCP Apps. For local development, you’ll need to expose your server to the internet. You can run an MCP server locally and use tools like `cloudflared` to tunnel traffic through. In a separate terminal, run:

Copy

``` shiki
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3001
```

Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`) and add it as a [custom connector](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp) in Claude - click on your profile, go to **Settings**, **Connectors**, and finally **Add custom connector**.

Custom connectors are available on paid Claude plans (Pro, Max, or Team).

### 

[​](#testing-with-the-basic-host)

Testing with the basic-host

The `ext-apps` repository includes a test host for development. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

macOS/Linux

Windows

Copy

``` shiki
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps.git
cd ext-apps/examples/basic-host
npm install
```

Running `npm start` from `ext-apps/examples/basic-host/` will start the basic-host test interface. To connect it to a specific server (e.g., one you’re developing), pass the `SERVERS` environment variable inline:

macOS/Linux

Windows

Copy

``` shiki
SERVERS='["http://localhost:3001/mcp"]' npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You’ll see a simple interface where you can select a tool and call it. When you call your tool, the host fetches the UI resource and renders it in a sandboxed iframe. You can then interact with your app and verify that tool calls work correctly.
