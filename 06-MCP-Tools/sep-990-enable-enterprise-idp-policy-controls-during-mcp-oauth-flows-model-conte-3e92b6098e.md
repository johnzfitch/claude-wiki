[​](#abstract)

Abstract

This extension is designed to facilitate secure and interoperable authorization of MCP clients within corporate environments, leveraging existing enterprise identity infrastructure.

- For end users, this removes the need to manually connect and authorize the MCP Client to individual services within the organization.
- For enterprise admins, this enables visibility and control over which MCP Servers are able to be used within the organization.
