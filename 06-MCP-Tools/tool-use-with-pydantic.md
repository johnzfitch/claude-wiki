# Note-Saving Tool with Pydantic and Anthropic Tool Use

In this example, we\'ll create a tool that saves a note with the author
and metadata, and use Pydantic to validate the model\'s response when
calling the tool. We\'ll define the necessary Pydantic models, process
the tool call, and ensure that the model\'s response conforms to the
expected schema.
:::

## Step 1: Set up the environment

First, let\'s install the required libraries and set up the Claude API
client.
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
%pip install anthropic pydantic 'pydantic[email]'
```
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="2"}
``` python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, Field

client = Anthropic()
MODEL_NAME = "claude-opus-4-1"
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 2: Define the Pydantic models

We\'ll define Pydantic models to represent the expected schema for the
note, author, and the model\'s response. This will allow us to validate
and type-check the model\'s response when saving a note.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="18"}
``` python
class Author(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr


class Note(BaseModel):
    note: str
    author: Author
    tags: list[str] | None = None
    priority: int = Field(ge=1, le=5, default=3)
    is_public: bool = False


class SaveNoteResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    message: str
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 3: Define the client-side tool

Next, we\'ll define the client-side tool that our chatbot will use to
save notes.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="17"}
``` python
tools = [
    {
        "name": "save_note",
        "description": "A tool that saves a note with the author and metadata.",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "note": {"type": "string", "description": "The content of the note to be saved."},
                "author": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {"type": "string", "description": "The name of the author."},
                        "email": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "format": "email",
                            "description": "The email address of the author.",
                        },
                    },
                    "required": ["name", "email"],
                },
                "priority": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": 1,
                    "maximum": 5,
                    "default": 3,
                    "description": "The priority level of the note (1-5).",
                },
                "is_public": {
                    "type": "boolean",
                    "default": False,
                    "description": "Indicates whether the note is publicly accessible.",
                },
            },
            "required": ["note", "author"],
        },
    }
]
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 4: Implement the note-saving tool

We\'ll create a dummy note saving function that just prints out that the
note was saved successfully. If you actually want this note to be saved
somewhere, you can implement this function.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="23"}
``` python
def save_note(note: str, author: dict, priority: int = 3, is_public: bool = False) -> None:
    print("Note saved successfully!")
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 5: Process the tool call and generate the response

We\'ll create functions to process the tool call made by Claude and
generate the response indicating the success of saving the note.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="24"}
``` python
def process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input):
    if tool_name == "save_note":
        note = Note(
            note=tool_input["note"],
            author=Author(name=tool_input["author"]["name"], email=tool_input["author"]["email"]),
            priority=tool_input.get("priority", 3),
            is_public=tool_input.get("is_public", False),
        )
        save_note(note.note, note.author.model_dump(), note.priority, note.is_public)
        return SaveNoteResponse(success=True, message="Note saved successfully!")


def generate_response(save_note_response):
    return f"Response: {save_note_response.message}"
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 6: Interact with the chatbot

Now, let\'s create a function to interact with the chatbot. We\'ll send
a user message, process the tool call made by Claude, generate the
response, validate the model\'s response using Pydantic, and return the
final response to the user.
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="21"}
``` python
def chatbot_interaction(user_message):
    print(f"\n{'=' * 50}\nUser Message: {user_message}\n{'=' * 50}")

    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]

    message = client.messages.create(
        model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=4096, tools=tools, messages=messages
    )

    print("\nInitial Response:")
    print(f"Stop Reason: {message.stop_reason}")
    print(f"Content: {message.content}")

    if message.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        tool_use = next(block for block in message.content if block.type == "tool_use")
        tool_name = tool_use.name
        tool_input = tool_use.input

        print(f"\nTool Used: {tool_name}")
        print(f"Tool Input: {tool_input}")

        save_note_response = process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input)

        print(f"Tool Result: {save_note_response}")

        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL_NAME,
            max_tokens=4096,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": user_message},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": message.content},
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "tool_result",
                            "tool_use_id": tool_use.id,
                            "content": str(save_note_response),
                        }
                    ],
                },
            ],
            tools=tools,
        )
    else:
        response = message

    final_response = next(
        (block.text for block in response.content if hasattr(block, "text")),
        None,
    )
    print(response.content)
    print(f"\nFinal Response: {final_response}")

    return final_response
```

## Step 7: Test the chatbot

Let\'s test our chatbot with a sample query to save a note.
:::

::::: {.cell .code execution_count="26"}
``` python
chatbot_interaction("""
Can you save a private note with the following details?
Note: Remember to buy milk and eggs.
Author: John Doe (johndoe@gmail.com)
Priority: 4
""")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}

    ==================================================

    Initial Response:
    Stop Reason: tool_use
    Content: [ContentBlock(text='<thinking>\nThe relevant tool to use here is save_note, as the request is to save a note with specific details.\n\nLet\'s go through the parameters one-by-one:\n\nnote: The user provided the note content: "Remember to buy milk and eggs."\nauthor: The user provided the author details: \n{\n  "name": "John Doe",\n  "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"\n}\nis_public: While the user didn\'t explicitly specify, they asked for a "private note", so we can infer is_public should be false.\npriority: The user specified a priority of 4.\n\nAll the required parameters have been provided or can be reasonably inferred from the request.

    Tool Used: save_note
    Tool Input: {'note': 'Remember to buy milk and eggs.', 'author': {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@gmail.com'}, 'is_public': False, 'priority': 4}
    Note saved successfully!
    Tool Result: success=True message='Note saved successfully!'
    [ContentBlock(text='Your private note has been saved successfully with the following details:\n\nNote: Remember to buy milk and eggs. \nAuthor: John Doe (johndoe@gmail.com)\nPriority: 4\nVisibility: Private\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else!', type='text')]

    Final Response: Your private note has been saved successfully with the following details:

    Note: Remember to buy milk and eggs. 
    Author: John Doe (johndoe@gmail.com)
    Priority: 4
    Visibility: Private

    Please let me know if you need anything else!
:::

::: {.output .execute_result execution_count="26"}
    'Your private note has been saved successfully with the following details:\n\nNote: Remember to buy milk and eggs. \nAuthor: John Doe (johndoe@gmail.com)\nPriority: 4\nVisibility: Private\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else!'
:::
:::::

::: {.cell .markdown}
In this example, we\'ve created a tool that saves a note with the author
and metadata. The chatbot uses the save_note tool to save the note, and
Pydantic is used to validate the model\'s response when calling the
tool. The Note, Author, and SaveNoteResponse models ensure that the tool
input and the model\'s response conform to the expected schema.

By defining clear Pydantic models and using them to validate the
model\'s response, we add an extra layer of reliability and safety when
interacting with the chatbot and saving notes.
