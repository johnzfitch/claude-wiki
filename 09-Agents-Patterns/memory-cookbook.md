# Context Editing & Memory for Long-Running Agents {#context-editing--memory-for-long-running-agents}

AI agents that run across multiple sessions or handle long-running tasks
face two key challenges: they lose learned patterns between
conversations, and context windows fill up during extended interactions.

This cookbook demonstrates how to address these challenges using
Claude\'s memory tool and context editing capabilities.

## 1. Introduction: Why Memory Matters {#introduction} {#1-introduction-why-memory-matters-introduction}

This cookbook demonstrates practical implementations of the context
engineering patterns described in [Effective context engineering for AI
agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents).
That post covers why context is a finite resource, how attention budgets
work, and strategies for building effective agents---the techniques
you\'ll see in action here.

### The Problem

Large language models have finite context windows (200k tokens for the
Claude 4 family of models). While this seems large, several challenges
emerge:

- **Context limits**: Long conversations or complex tasks can exceed
  available context
- **Computational cost**: Processing large contexts is expensive -
  attention mechanisms scale quadratically
- **Repeated patterns**: Similar tasks across conversations require
  re-explaining context every time
- **Information loss**: When context fills up, earlier important
  information gets lost

### The Solution

Claude 4 models introduce powerful context management capabilities:

1.  **Memory Tool** (`memory_20250818`): Enables cross-conversation
    learning
    - Claude can write down what it learns for future reference
    - File-based system under `/memories` directory
    - Client-side implementation gives you full control
2.  **Context Editing**: Automatically manages context with two
    strategies:
    - **Tool use clearing** (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`): Clears old
      tool results when context grows large
    - **Thinking management** (`clear_thinking_20251015`): Manages
      extended thinking blocks (requires thinking enabled)
    - Configurable triggers and retention policies

### The Benefit

Build AI agents that **get better at your specific tasks over time**:

- **Session 1**: Claude solves a problem, writes down the pattern
- **Session 2**: Claude applies the learned pattern immediately
  (faster!)
- **Long sessions**: Context editing keeps conversations manageable

Think of it as giving Claude a notebook to take notes and refer back
to - just like humans do.

### What You\'ll Learn

By the end of this cookbook, you will be able to:

- **Implement** the memory tool for cross-conversation learning
- **Configure** context editing to manage long-running sessions
- **Apply** best practices for memory security and organization

```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
**⚠️ Important**: Create a `.env` file in this directory:

``` bash
# Copy .env.example to .env and add your API key
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` to add your Anthropic API key from
<https://console.anthropic.com/>

### Example 1: Basic Memory Usage

Let\'s see Claude use memory to store information for future reference.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
**Helper Functions**

These examples use helper functions from `demo_helpers.py`:

- **`run_conversation_loop()`**: Handles the API conversation loop
  - Calls Claude\'s API with memory tool enabled
  - Executes tool uses (memory operations)
  - Continues until Claude stops using tools
  - Returns the final response
- **`run_conversation_turn()`**: Single turn (used in Example 3)
  - Same as above but returns after one API call
  - Useful when you need fine-grained control
- **`print_context_management_info()`**: Displays context clearing stats
  - Shows tokens saved, tool uses cleared
  - Helps visualize when context editing triggers
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
**⚠️ Note on Memory Clearing**

The following cell clears all memory files to provide a clean slate for
this demonstration. This is useful for running the notebook multiple
times to see consistent results.

**In production applications**, you should carefully consider whether to
clear all memory, as it permanently removes learned patterns. Consider
using selective deletion or organizing memory into project-specific
directories instead.

    💬 Claude: ## Code Review: Multi-threaded Web Scraper Race Condition

    ### 🔴 **Critical Issue Found: Race Condition in Shared State**

    You've correctly identified the problem! The code has **race conditions** caused by multiple threads modifying shared lists without synchronization.

    ---

    ### **The Problem**

    **Lines with race conditions:**
    ```python
    self.results.append(result)  # RACE CONDITION
    ```

    **Problem:** 
    - Python's `list.append()` is **NOT thread-safe** for concurrent modifications
    - Multiple threads simultaneously appending can cause:
      - **Lost updates:** One thread's append overwrites another's
      - **Inconsistent state:** Internal list structure can be corrupted
      - **Unpredictable counts:** Results randomly dropped

    **Why it happens:**
    `list.append()` involves multiple operations:
    1. Read current list size
    2. Allocate space
    3. Insert item
    4. Update size

    # In scrape_urls():
    if "error" in result:
        self.failed_urls.append(result["url"])  # ⚠️ NOT THREAD-SAFE
    else:
        self.results.append(result)  # ⚠️ NOT THREAD-SAFE
    ```

    **Why this causes lost results:**
    - Python's `list.append()` is **not atomic** in all scenarios
    - When multiple threads call `append()` simultaneously, the internal list operations can interleave
    - This can cause lost updates where one thread's append overwrites another's

    ---

    ### **Solutions**

    #### **Option 1: Use Thread Locks (Traditional approach)**
    ```python
    import threading

    class WebScraper:
        """Web scraper that fetches multiple URLs concurrently."""

        def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 10):
            self.max_workers = max_workers
            self.results = []
            self.failed_urls = []
            self.lock = threading.Lock()  # ✅ Add lock

        def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
            with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
                futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

                for future in as_completed(futures):
                    result = future.result()

                    # ✅ Protect shared state with lock
                    with self.lock:
                        if "error" in result:
                            self.failed_urls.append(result["url"])
                        else:
                            self.results.append(result)

            return self.results
    ```

    #### **Option 2: Use Thread-Safe Collections**
    ```python
    from queue import Queue

    class WebScraper:
        """Web scraper that fetches multiple URLs concurrently."""

        def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 10):
            self.max_workers = max_workers
            self.results = Queue()  # ✅ Thread-safe
            self.failed_urls = Queue()  # ✅ Thread-safe

        def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
            with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
                futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

                for future in as_completed(futures):
                    result = future.result()

                    if "error" in result:
                        self.failed_urls.put(result["url"])
                    else:
                        self.results.put(result)

            # Convert Queue to list for return
            return list(self.results.queue)
    ```

    #### **Option 3: Collect Results from Futures (Best approach)**
    ```python
    def scrape_urls(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        ✅ FIXED: Collect results in main thread, avoiding shared state.
        """
        results = []  # Local to main thread
        failed_urls = []  # Local to main thread
        
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

            for future in as_completed(futures):
                result = future.result()

                # ✅ Only main thread accesses these lists
                if "error" in result:
                    failed_urls.append(result["url"])
                else:
                    results.append(result)

        # Update instance variables once, in main thread
        self.results = results
        self.failed_urls = failed_urls
        
        return self.results
    ```

    ---

    ### **Recommended Fix (Complete)**

    Here's the fully corrected version using **Option 3** (cleanest approach):

    ```python
    """

    ---

    ### **Summary**

    - **Root cause**: Multiple threads appending to shared lists (`self.results` and `self.failed_urls`) without synchronization
    - **Impact**: Lost updates leading to inconsistent result counts
    - **Best fix**: Collect results in local variables within the main thread, then update instance variables once
    - **Why this works**: Only one thread (main) accesses the result lists, eliminating the race condition entirely

    The key insight: **Avoid shared mutable state in concurrent code**. Let worker threads return values and collect them in the coordinating thread.

**What happened?**

1.  Claude checked its memory (empty on first run)
2.  Identified the bug: **race condition** - multiple threads modifying
    shared state (`self.results` and `self.failed_urls`) without
    synchronization
3.  Stored the concurrency pattern in memory for future reference

Now let\'s see the magic - Claude applying this learned pattern in a
**new conversation**:

    💬 Claude: ## Code Review: Async API Client

    ### Summary
    This code has **concurrency issues** related to shared mutable state being accessed from multiple coroutines without proper synchronization. While the author correctly identifies these as bugs in comments, let me provide a comprehensive review.

    However, the actual race condition risk here is **somewhat overstated** because:
    - List `.append()` is atomic in CPython
    - The `+=` operation on integers is also atomic
    - Coroutines only switch at `await` points, and there are none between the operations

    **BUT** this is still problematic because:
    - It relies on CPython implementation details
    - It's not guaranteed by the language specification
    - The code is not portable to other Python implementations
    - Future refactoring could introduce `await` points that cause real races

    #### 1. **Race Condition on `self.error_count` (Line 51)**
    ```python
    self.error_count += 1  # Not atomic!
    ```

    **Problem**: Even in async code, this operation is not atomic. While asyncio is single-threaded, the `+=` operator involves:
    1. Read current value
    2. Add 1
    3. Write back

    An `await` in another coroutine between steps 1-3 can cause lost updates.

    **Impact**: Error count will be incorrect/underreported.

    #### 2. **Unsafe List Append on `self.responses` (Line 53)**
    ```python
    self.responses.append(result)  # Not thread-safe in async context!
    ```

    **Problem**: While `list.append()` is technically atomic in CPython due to GIL, this is:
    - An implementation detail, not guaranteed by the language spec
    - Bad practice that makes the code fragile
    - Still problematic because the list is being modified while potentially being read elsewhere

    **Impact**: Potential data corruption, missing responses, or incorrect counts.

    #### 3. **Logic Error: Errors Not Included in Results**
    ```python
    if "error" in result:
        self.error_count += 1  # Counted but not stored!
    else:
        self.responses.append(result)  # Only successes stored
    ```

    **Problem**: Failed requests increment `error_count` but are **never added to `self.responses`**. This means:
    - The return value of `fetch_all()` only contains successful responses
    - Error details are lost
    - The summary calculation is inconsistent

    ---

    ### ⚠️ **Design Issues**

    #### 4. **Stateful Class Design is Anti-Pattern for Concurrent Operations**
    The class maintains mutable state (`responses`, `error_count`) that's modified during concurrent operations. This is problematic because:
    - Makes the client non-reusable (calling `fetch_all()` twice will mix results)
    - Harder to reason about state consistency
    - Requires manual reset between calls

    **Better approach**: Return data directly rather than accumulating in instance variables.

    #### 5. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
    Errors are caught and converted to dictionaries, but then handled differently from successes. This makes the API inconsistent and loses valuable error information.

    ---

    ### 🟡 **Minor Issues**

    #### 6. **Missing Type Hints**
    The module imports `Optional` but never uses it. The return types could be more specific.

    #### 7. **Hardcoded Test Data in Main**
    The `* 20` multiplier and specific endpoints make testing less flexible.

    **Fix:** Use `asyncio.gather()` which is simpler and more idiomatic for this use case.

    ### 5. **Missing HTTP Status Code Validation**
    **Location:** `fetch_endpoint()` method

    ### **Key Improvements in Fixed Version:**

    1. ✅ **No shared mutable state** - Results returned directly
    2. ✅ **All results captured** - Both successes and errors included
    3. ✅ **Type-safe with dataclass** - Clear structure for results
    4. ✅ **Reusable client** - Can call `fetch_all()` multiple times safely
    5. ✅ **Consistent error handling** - All results have same structure
    6. ✅ **Simpler concurrency** - Uses `asyncio.gather()` instead of `as_completed()`
    7. ✅ **Static summary method** - Takes results as parameter, no state dependency

    ---

    ### **Alternative: If You Need Shared State**

    If you absolutely need to accumulate results in the instance (e.g., for streaming/progressive updates), use an `asyncio.Lock`:

    ```python
    import asyncio

    class AsyncAPIClient:
        def __init__(self, base_url: str):
            self.base_url = base_url
            self.responses = []
            self.error_count = 0
            self._lock = asyncio.Lock()  # Add lock

        async def fetch_all(self, endpoints: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
            async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
                tasks = [self.fetch_endpoint(session, endpoint) for endpoint in endpoints]
                
                for coro in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
                    result = await coro
                    
                    # Protect shared state with lock
                    async with self._lock:
                        if "error" in result:
                            self.error_count += 1
                        else:
                            self.responses.append(result)
            
            return self.responses
    ```

    However, the stateless design I showed first is **strongly preferred** for async code.

    import asyncio
    from typing import List, Dict, Any, TypedDict

    ### **Testing Recommendation**

    Add tests that verify all 120 requests are accounted for:

    ```python
    async def test_all_results_captured():
        client = AsyncAPIClient("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")
        endpoints = ["posts/1"] * 100
        results = await client.fetch_all(endpoints)
        assert len(results) == 100, f"Expected 100, got {len(results)}"
    ```

**Notice the difference:**

- Claude **immediately checked memory** and found the
  thread-safety/concurrency pattern
- Recognized the similar issue in async code **instantly** without
  re-learning
- Response was **faster** because it applied stored knowledge about
  shared mutable state

This is **cross-conversation learning** in action!

### Example 3: Context Clearing While Preserving Memory

What happens during a **long review session** with many code files?

- Context fills up with tool results from previous reviews
- But memory (learned patterns) must persist!

Let\'s trigger **context editing** to see how Claude manages this
automatically.

**Note on configuration:** We use `clear_at_least: 50` tokens because
memory tool operations have small results (\~50-150 tokens each). In
production with larger tool results (like web search or code execution),
you\'d use higher values like 3000-5000 tokens.

**What just happened?**

As context grew during multiple reviews with extended thinking enabled,
context editing was applied:

1.  **Thinking blocks cleared** - Old thinking from previous turns
    removed first
2.  **Tool results cleared** - Old memory tool results removed when
    threshold exceeded
3.  **Memory files intact** - Claude can still query learned patterns
4.  **Token usage managed** - Saved tokens from both thinking and tool
    results

This demonstrates the key benefit:

- **Short-term memory** (conversation context + thinking) → Cleared to
  save space
- **Long-term memory** (stored patterns) → Persists across sessions

Let\'s verify memory survived the clearing:

### Memory Tool Architecture

The memory tool is **client-side** - you control the storage. Claude
makes tool calls, your application executes them.

#### Memory Tool Commands

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command              Description                   Example
  -------------------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `view`               Show directory or file        `{"command": "view", "path": "/memories"}`
                       contents                      

  `create`             Create or overwrite a file    `{"command": "create", "path": "/memories/notes.md", "file_text": "..."}`

  `str_replace`        Replace text in a file        `{"command": "str_replace", "path": "...", "old_str": "...", "new_str": "..."}`

  `insert`             Insert text at line number    `{"command": "insert", "path": "...", "insert_line": 2, "insert_text": "..."}`

  `delete`             Delete a file or directory    `{"command": "delete", "path": "/memories/old.txt"}`

  `rename`             Rename or move a file         `{"command": "rename", "old_path": "...", "new_path": "..."}`

### Thinking Management (`clear_thinking_20251015`)

When using extended thinking, thinking blocks accumulate and consume
tokens. The `clear_thinking` strategy manages these automatically.

**Important**: This strategy requires `thinking` to be enabled in your
API call.

**API Call Pattern** (with extended thinking enabled):

``` python
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],  # Required beta flag
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    messages=messages,
    tools=[{"type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory"}],
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 10000},  # Enable thinking
    context_management={  # Context editing config
        "edits": [
            {
                "type": "clear_thinking_20251015",
                "keep": {"type": "thinking_turns", "value": 1}  # Keep last turn only
            },
            {
                "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
                "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 35000},
                "keep": {"type": "tool_uses", "value": 5}
            }
        ]
    },
    max_tokens=2048
)
```

**Key points:**

- `clear_thinking` must come **first** when combining strategies
- Requires extended thinking to be enabled
  (`thinking={"type": "enabled", ...}`)
- Use `"keep": "all"` to preserve all thinking blocks for maximum cache
  hits
- Trigger is optional for thinking (clears based on `keep` value)

### Understanding the Demo Code

Key implementation details from `code_review_demo.py`:

``` python
class CodeReviewAssistant:
    def __init__(self, memory_storage_path="./memory_storage"):
        self.client = Anthropic()
        self.memory_handler = MemoryToolHandler(base_path=memory_storage_path)
        self.messages = []
    
    def review_code(self, code, filename, description=""):
        # 1. Add user message
        self.messages.append({...})
        
        # 2. Conversation loop with tool execution
        while True:
            response = self.client.beta.messages.create(
                model=MODEL,
                system=self._create_system_prompt(),
                messages=self.messages,
                tools=[{"type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory"}],
                betas=["context-management-2025-06-27"],
                context_management=CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT
            )
            
            # 3. Execute tool uses
            tool_results = []
            for content in response.content:
                if content.type == "tool_use":
                    result = self._execute_tool_use(content)
                    tool_results.append({...})
            
            # 4. Continue if there are tool uses, otherwise done
            if tool_results:
                self.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})
            else:
                break
```

**The key pattern**: Keep calling the API while there are tool uses,
executing them and feeding results back.

### What Claude Actually Learns

This is what makes memory powerful - **semantic pattern recognition**,
not just syntax:

**Session 1: Thread-Based Web Scraper**

``` python
# Bug: Race condition
class WebScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.results = []  # Shared state!
    
    def scrape_urls(self, urls):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            for future in as_completed(futures):
                self.results.append(future.result())  # RACE!
```

**What Claude Stores in Memory** (example file:
`/memories/concurrency_patterns/thread_safety.md`):

When Claude encounters this pattern, it stores the following insights to
its memory files:

- **Symptom**: Inconsistent results in concurrent operations
- **Cause**: Shared mutable state (lists/dicts) modified from multiple
  threads
- **Solution**: Use locks, thread-safe data structures, or return
  results instead
- **Red flags**: Instance variables in thread callbacks, unused locks,
  counter increments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Session 2: Async API Client** (New conversation!)

Claude checks memory FIRST, finds the thread-safety pattern, then:

1.  **Recognizes** similar pattern in async code (coroutines can
    interleave too)
2.  **Applies** the solution immediately (no re-learning needed)
3.  **Explains** with reference to stored knowledge

``` python
# Claude spots this immediately:
async def fetch_all(self, endpoints):
    for coro in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
        self.responses.append(await coro)  # Same pattern!
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why This Matters:**

- ❌ **Syntax checkers** miss race conditions entirely
- ✅ **Claude learns** architectural patterns and applies them across
  contexts
- ✅ **Cross-language**: Pattern applies to Go, Java, Rust concurrency
  too
- ✅ **Gets better**: Each review adds to the knowledge base

### Sample Code Files

The demo uses these sample files (all have concurrency/thread-safety
bugs):

- `memory_demo/sample_code/web_scraper_v1.py` - Race condition: threads
  modifying shared state
- `memory_demo/sample_code/api_client_v1.py` - Similar concurrency bug
  in async context
- `memory_demo/sample_code/data_processor_v1.py` - Multiple concurrency
  issues for long session demo

Let\'s look at one:

from typing import List, Dict

import requests


class WebScraper:
    """Web scraper that fetches multiple URLs concurrently."""

    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 10):
        self.max_workers = max_workers
        self.results = []  # BUG: Shared mutable state accessed by multiple threads!
        self.failed_urls = []  # BUG: Another race condition!

    def fetch_url(self, url: str) -> Dict[str, any]:

        BUG: self.results is accessed from multiple threads without locking!
        This causes race conditions where results can be lost or corrupted.
        """
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(self.fetch_url, url) for url in urls]

            for future in as_completed(futures):
                result = future.result()

                # RACE CONDITION: Multiple threads append to self.results simultaneously
                if "error" in result:
                    self.failed_urls.append(result["url"])  # RACE CONDITION
                else:
                    self.results.append(result)  # RACE CONDITION

        return self.results
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
**Bug**: Multiple threads modify `self.results` and `self.failed_urls`
without locking!

Claude will:

1.  Identify the race conditions
2.  Store the pattern in
    `/memories/concurrency_patterns/thread_safety.md`
3.  Apply this concurrency pattern to async code in Session 2

### Demo Overview

We\'ve built a complete Code Review Assistant. The implementation is in
`memory_demo/code_review_demo.py`.

**To run the interactive demo:**

``` bash
python memory_demo/code_review_demo.py
```

The demo demonstrates:

1.  **Session 1**: Review Python code with a bug → Claude learns the
    pattern
2.  **Session 2**: Review similar code (new conversation) → Claude
    applies the pattern
3.  **Session 3**: Long review session → Context editing keeps it
    manageable

## 7. Best Practices & Security {#best-practices} {#7-best-practices--security-best-practices}

### Memory Management

**Do:**

- ✅ Store task-relevant patterns, not conversation history
- ✅ Organize with clear directory structure
- ✅ Use descriptive file names
- ✅ Periodically review and clean up memory

**Don\'t:**

- ❌ Store sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII)
- ❌ Let memory grow unbounded
- ❌ Store everything indiscriminately

### Security: Path Traversal Protection

**Critical**: Always validate paths to prevent directory traversal
attacks. See `memory_tool.py` for implementation.

### Security: Memory Poisoning

**⚠️ Critical Risk**: Memory files are read back into Claude\'s context,
making them a potential vector for prompt injection.

**Mitigation strategies:**

1.  **Content Sanitization**: Filter dangerous patterns before storing
2.  **Memory Scope Isolation**: Per-user/per-project isolation\
3.  **Memory Auditing**: Log and scan all memory operations
4.  **Prompt Engineering**: Instruct Claude to ignore instructions in
    memory

See `memory_tool.py` for complete security implementation and tests in
`tests/`.

## Conclusion

### What You Accomplished

In this cookbook, you learned to:

- ✅ **Implement the memory tool** for cross-conversation learning
  (Sessions 1 & 2 showed pattern recognition persisting)
- ✅ **Configure context editing** with token triggers and retention
  policies (Session 3 demonstrated automatic clearing)
- ✅ **Apply security best practices** including path validation and
  memory poisoning prevention

### Applying These Patterns

**For your projects:**

1.  Start with a single memory file for patterns (e.g.,
    `/memories/patterns.md`)
2.  Set context editing triggers at 30-40k tokens for production use
3.  Implement per-project memory isolation to prevent
    cross-contamination

**Other applications:**

- **Customer support**: Store user preferences and common issue
  resolutions
- **Research assistants**: Accumulate domain knowledge across sessions
- **Data analysis**: Remember dataset characteristics and successful
  techniques

### Next Steps

- **Production deployment**: Use
  [claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)
  for GitHub PR reviews
- **Security hardening**: Review the memory poisoning mitigations in
  `memory_tool.py`
- **Extended thinking**: Explore thinking management for
  compute-intensive tasks
