Prompt engineering
Automatically generate first draft prompt templates
Copy page

Our prompt generator is compatible with all Claude models, including those with extended thinking capabilities. For prompting tips specific to extended thinking models, see here.

Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we've created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices.

The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the "blank page problem" to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.

Try the prompt generator now directly on the Console.

If you're interested in analyzing the underlying prompt and architecture, check out our prompt generator Google Colab notebook. There, you can easily run the code to have Claude construct prompts on your behalf.

Note that to run the Colab notebook, you will need an API key.
