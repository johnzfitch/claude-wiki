Prompt engineering

# Use XML tags to structure your prompts

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

**XML tip**: Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.

## 

Why use XML tags?

- **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
- **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
- **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

Tagging best practices

1.  **Be consistent**: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
2.  **Nest tags**: You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.

**Power user tip**: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.
