Welcome to the Claude for Nonprofits community! This guide provides everything you need to successfully launch and scale Claude at your organization. 

We've designed a flexible, self-paced approach that can be adapted to meet your organization’s needs. Move through these milestones at your own pace:

Foundation (Technical Setup and Access)

Activation (First Users and Early Wins)

Acceleration (Scaling and Integration)

Expansion (Advanced Use Cases and Impact)

Foundation (Technical Setup and Access) 

Key Resources:

Getting Started Guides - SSO, user management, and technical configuration to guide admin through the technical set-up

Driving Adoption at your Organization - Course includes customizable templates for change management and adoption for your organization

Recommendation Actions:

Complete user management and technical configuration steps (SSO, SCIM, etc.)

Set data retention and sharing policies

Define success metrics using audit log data for activity tracking and consider surveys for deeper insights

Plan your change management strategy and set success criteria 

Implementation Tips:

Identify an implementation leader who can go through the above Driving Adoption at your Organization course to help customize a plan for your organization’s adoption and help define success metrics 

Challenges are normal. Successful organizations acknowledge challenges early, iterate quickly, and maintain open communication. Start a Slack/Teams channel or office hours, and identify an owner early—strong facilitation keeps these spaces active and valuable.

Bookmark the Claude Help Center as your go-to resource for technical questions. 

 

Activation (First Users and Early Wins) 

Key Resources:

On-Demand AI Fluency Courses

Use Case and Workflow Planning

Recommendation Actions: 

Create a shared project and upload Claude documentation so all team members can reference and understand your approach (an alternative approach would be making this available on an internal intranet)

Find 3-5 enthusiastic team members to invest in the pilot and provide early feedback. Anoint these champions as go-to experts in Slack/Teams to field questions and keep conversations active.

Choose your first few uses cases: Start with a horizontal productivity win (fast, visible, broad impact), then quickly layer in a department-specific use case that shows what's newly possible—not just faster, but fundamentally different

 

Implementation Tips: 

Consider starting a Slack/Teams channel or office hours to support ongoing discussions and share your success. 

Host an internal 30 day retrospective to capture lessons learned. Leverage Claude to plan this out and consider this prompt as a starting place: You are a facilitator helping plan a lessons learned retrospective for teams implementing Claude. When given context about the audience and timeframe, generate: (1) a clear agenda with time allocations, (2) an interactive activity that surfaces both wins and growth areas, and (3) a brief 'why this matters' framing to open the session. Keep the tone collaborative and forward-looking, not blame-oriented.

Consider sending a baseline survey to licensed users to track progress and capture use cases. 

 

Acceleration (Scaling and Integration)

Key Resources: 

Nonprofit Use Cases 

How to access audit logs

Claude Artifact Inspo

MCP Connector Directory

Recommendation Actions: 

Build a weekly use case spotlight schedule 

Track activity metrics using audit logs and success metrics through other collection methods such as surveys

Identify and enable appropriate connectors and capabilities (in admin settings)

Participate in monthly webinar series every third week of the month (email will be sent with invites to all registered admin) 

Implementation Tips:

Monitor leading indicators for strong engagement: % of weekly active users, % with 10+ chats, % using projects.

Share success stories internally frequently—both wins and challenges help build organizational momentum.

 

Expansion (Advanced Use Cases and Impact)

Key Resources: 

Claude Train the Trainer Program

Case Studies Hub

Recommendation Actions: 

Run an internal Train the trainer, our self-paced course to help build internal expertise and scale 

Identify new functions or areas of the organization that are interested in adopting Claude and determine what expansion rollout might look like

Implementation Tips:

Sustainable adoption means building internal expertise. As AI becomes embedded in role expectations rather than remaining optional, your trained champions become the peer support network that scales beyond what any single admin can provide

Your Success, Our Priority

Remember, there's no "right" timeline for implementation. Whether you're moving quickly toward organization-wide adoption or taking a measured, department-specific approach, we're here to support your journey and be your partner in this transformation!
