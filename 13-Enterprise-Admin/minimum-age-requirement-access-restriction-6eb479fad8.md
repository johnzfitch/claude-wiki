This article explains why you may be unable to create a Claude account or sign in to an existing account when using the Claude mobile app.

 

Why am I seeing this message?

We require all users to be at least 18 years old to create and use a Claude account. If you're seeing this message, it means the app store on your device (App Store or Play Store) has identified you as under 18 based on your account information.

In certain US states, new laws require app stores to verify users' ages and share that information with app developers. Claude uses this information to enforce our minimum age requirement. This requirement is being rolled out in stages across different states.

 

What if my age is incorrect?

Anthropic does not have access to your app store account information and cannot change it. If you believe your age has been reported incorrectly, you'll need to contact the appropriate support team for your device:

iOS: Contact Apple Support

Android: Contact Google Play Support

Your age information is managed through your Google account or Apple Account. If your account is part of a family group (such as Google Family Link or Apple Family Sharing), your age may have been set by a parent or guardian when the account was created. You may need to work with them to review or update your account information.
