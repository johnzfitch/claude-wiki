Claude integrations allow you to seamlessly connect Claude with your existing tools and workflows. This guide explains integration availability and how to set them up based on your plan.

## Integration availability by plan

[TABLE]

## Enabling integrations on Claude

To use integrations on Claude, you must authenticate through the third party first.

Some integrations can be enabled within your chat interface. Click the "+" button on the lower left corner of the chat interface, select the integration you'd like to enable, and follow the instructions to authenticate.

Some integrations need to be enabled from Settings first. To do this:

1.  Navigate to [Settings \> Connectors](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors).

2.  Locate the integration you want to enable in the list.

3.  Click the “Connect” button next to the integration you’d like to use.

4.  Follow the instructions to authenticate.

## Enabling integrations on Team and Enterprise Plans

To enable integrations on a Team or Enterprise plan, you must be an organization Owner.

1.  Navigate to [Admin settings \> Connectors](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/connectors).

2.  Under “Connectors,” click the "Enable" button next to the integration you’d like to make available to your members.

3.  Users can then individually authenticate to begin using the integration.

## Security and privacy considerations

- All data transfers are encrypted.

- When using integrations, you can only sync content to Claude.ai that you have permission to view in the original source.

### Considerations for Team and Enterprise plans

- Access permissions are enforced at the user level. Users will need to authenticate with the third party when first using the feature, even after an Owner or Primary Owner enables the integration.

- Integrations are only available in private projects.

- Chats with synced content cannot be shared.
