# Work with Claude Tag

Copy pageCopy page

Claude Tag puts Claude in your Slack channels with admin-governed access. See what to hand it, how setup works, and where to start as an admin or end user.

Public Beta

Tag @Claude in. Get results back in the thread.

Anyone in a channel can tag Claude into a problem and hand it work: reproduce a bug and open a pull request, turn a decision thread into a doc, assemble the state of a project. It posts a checklist in the thread as it goes, and the whole exchange stays visible to the channel.

same. @Claude can you investigate? Compare latency against this morning’s deploy and find what’s causing it.

On it. I’ll compare latency before and after the deploy, track down the cause, and report back here.

Plans that include Claude Tag

Claude Tag is available on Team and Enterprise plans, on Anthropic’s first-party service. It isn’t available on individual plans (Free, Pro, or Max), or for third-party deployments. To use it, your organization pairs its Slack workspace with its Claude organization; see [the setup overview](/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview) for the full prerequisites. If you’re choosing between Claude products for Slack-shaped work, [how Claude Tag differs from Cowork and Claude Code](/docs/claude-tag/concepts/how-it-works#how-claude-tag-differs-from-cowork-and-claude-code) compares them directly: team work in shared channels is Claude Tag; personal work on your own files is Cowork or Claude Code.


[​](#where-claude-tag-runs)

Where Claude Tag runs

Claude Tag works in Slack. You interact with it by writing in a Slack channel, thread, or direct message, and it replies there. Mention `@Claude` in a channel to guarantee it picks the message up. When Claude works on a task, it runs in an ephemeral sandbox hosted by Anthropic, not on your computer or inside your network. The sandbox is created when a conversation starts, holds any code or files Claude is working with, and is discarded when the conversation goes idle. See [how Claude Tag works](/docs/claude-tag/concepts/how-it-works) for the full lifecycle. You extend what Claude can reach, like your repositories, ticketing systems, data warehouses, and custom tools, through [connections](/docs/claude-tag/admins/add-connections), [plugins, and skills](/docs/claude-tag/admins/customize). An Owner configures these per scope (a channel, a workspace, or the whole organization), separately from any connectors an individual user has set up in their own claude.ai account.

[​](#billing-and-spend-limits)

Billing and spend limits

Adding Claude to Slack doesn’t add a per-seat charge. Channel and thread work is billed by usage instead: it draws from a **usage balance**, an amount in your organization’s billing currency that an Owner funds. A [spend limit](/docs/claude-tag/admins/set-spend-limit) caps how much of that balance Claude Tag can use each billing period. Direct messages don’t draw from this balance. A DM runs on the sender’s own claude.ai account and follows that seat’s usual usage limits, so the organization spend limit doesn’t apply to it. To learn what your team’s usage costs, run a pilot with a spend limit set and watch the per-channel breakdown on the [usage page in your admin settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/usage/claude-tag). Your organization may already have a [launch usage credit](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15575654-claude-tag-launch-promo-for-claude-team-and-enterprise) to run that pilot against before it funds the balance itself. [Set a spend limit](/docs/claude-tag/admins/set-spend-limit) covers how to fund the balance on each plan, set the limit, and what happens when usage reaches it.

For end users


[​](#put-claude-tag-to-work)

Put Claude Tag to work

If Claude Tag is in your channel, you can use it now. (If it isn’t there yet, an Owner in your Claude organization runs setup: see [Set up Claude Tag](/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview).) Anyone in the channel can hand it work, and channel work bills to the organization, not to you. What it can reach depends on the channel you’re in, not on who you are. The fastest way to find out is to ask it: `@Claude what can you access from this channel?` Or, if you’re signed in to your Claude organization, click **Configure** in the footer of any Claude reply to see the channel’s connections. The one exception is a DM, where it runs on your own claude.ai account instead of the channel’s setup. Owners can disable DMs organization-wide; see [Allow or disable direct messages](/docs/claude-tag/admins/restrict-access#allow-or-disable-direct-messages). Begin with [Get started](/docs/claude-tag/users/getting-started), which covers your first message, what you see while it works, and how to shape its behavior in your channel.

For administrators


[​](#set-claude-tag-up-once-for-everyone)

Set Claude Tag up once for everyone

Installing the Claude app in Slack is a prerequisite, not the setup. Setup is provisioning an identity. Claude Tag starts with no access to your external systems; you choose its credentials and repositories (an [Access bundle](/docs/claude-tag/concepts/glossary#access-bundle)), and which workspaces and channels they apply to. You configure this once, at [`claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag`](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-tag), and everyone in those places can use Claude Tag immediately, with no per-user setup. You must be an Owner in your Claude organization to run setup. [Set up Claude Tag](/docs/claude-tag/admins/setup-overview) walks the four provisioning steps, from creating the identity to attaching it to your first channel.
