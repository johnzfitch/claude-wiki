The Candid integration brings the power of Candid’s comprehensive nonprofit and funder data directly into Claude. This article explains how to set up and use the Candid connector to search millions of organizations, discover funding opportunities, and access expert knowledge about the social sector—all through natural conversation.

 

The Candid integration relies upon Claude’s ability to use remote connectors.

Available tools

The Candid MCP connector provides several powerful tools that Claude can use to answer your questions. Here are the main capabilities:

 

1. Search organizations

What it does: Search for nonprofits and foundations by name, mission description, location, or areas of work.

 

Use it for:

Finding specific organizations by name or EIN

Discovering organizations working on particular issues

Locating nonprofits serving specific geographic areas

Finding organizations with specific transparency levels or leadership demographics

Filter by subject areas and populations served

Filter by transparency seals (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze)

Filter by leader demographics (women, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities)

Access organizational mission and program information

 

2. Find mentioned organizations

What it does: Automatically identifies organization names in responses and links them to official Candid profiles.

 

Use it for:

Getting quick access to detailed organization profiles

Verifying organization information

Exploring organizations mentioned in research or news articles

How it works: When Claude mentions an organization, this tool finds the official match in Candid's database and creates clickable links to their profiles—no extra work required! If you have a paid subscription to Candid’s web products, you can also click through to see advanced information like specific grant histories, in-depth financials, affiliated people, or openness to funding applications.

 

3. Knowledge search

What it does: Search Candid's expert knowledge base including research reports, training materials, blog posts, and curated news.

 

Use it for:

Learning about trends in philanthropy

Finding best practices and expert guidance

4. Find relevant taxonomic terms

What it does: Uses AI to identify relevant terms from Candid's Philanthropy Classification System (PCS) taxonomy based on your description.

 

Use it for:

Understanding how Candid categorizes work in the social sector

Getting accurate taxonomy codes for advanced searches

Exploring related subject areas or populations served

Example queries:

"What taxonomy terms relate to mental health services for veterans?"

"Show me PCS codes for climate change work"

About the PCS taxonomy: Candid's taxonomy describes activity across the social and philanthropic sectors, covering subjects (what organizations work on) and populations served (who they serve). Learn more at taxonomy.candid.org.

 

Behind the scenes

The connector also includes technical tools that work automatically in the background to ensure accurate, timely results—like converting location descriptions into searchable geographic codes, or identifying the current date for time-sensitive queries. You don't need to think about these; Claude uses them automatically when needed.

 

 

Usage examples
Example 1: Finding organizations in your area

You ask: "I'm looking for foundations in California that fund youth education programs."

 

Claude will:

Use Search Organizations with relevant filters (admin1='CA', search terms related to youth education)

Return a list of matching foundations with links to their Candid profiles

Provide relevant details like location, mission focus, and Seals of Transparency level

Sample response:

Based on my search of Candid's database, I found several notable foundations in California that fund youth education programs:

 

Quest Foundation - Danville, CA

Has awarded 243 grants totaling over $9.3 million

Focuses on: elementary and secondary education, charter schools, higher education, reading promotion, and youth services

Also supports family services and child welfare

Ross Stores Foundation - Dublin, CA

Has awarded 225 grants totaling over $4 million

Accepts applications (though no current open funding opportunities listed)

Focuses on: higher education, out-of-school learning, reading promotion, and youth development

Specifically serves children and youth

[Additional details about their focus areas...]

 

Example 2: Researching sector trends

You ask: "What are the latest trends in climate philanthropy?"

 

Claude will:

Use Knowledge Search to find recent articles, research, and blog posts about climate philanthropy.

Use Find Mentioned Organizations to link any organizations mentioned in the content.

Synthesize findings into a comprehensive overview.

Sample response:

Based on the latest research and insights from the philanthropic sector, here are the key trends shaping climate philanthropy:

 

Significant Growth, But Still Insufficient

Foundation funding for climate mitigation nearly tripled from 2019 to 2023, reaching $4.8 billion according to ClimateWorks Foundation. However, this represents less than 2% of global philanthropic giving—far below what's needed to address the crisis.

 

Major Geographic Disparities

60% of single-region foundation funding goes to the U.S. and Europe, while Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America receive only 20%. Low- to middle-income countries most vulnerable to climate impacts capture just 14% of funding.

 

[Additional insights with citations and links...]

 

Example 3: Exploring organizations by mission

You ask: "Help me find nonprofits working on food access in Seattle that are highly transparent."

 

Claude will:

Use Find Named Locations to identify Seattle's geographic ID

Use Find Relevant Taxonomic Terms to identify food security subject codes

Use Search Organizations with location, subject, and Seals of Transparency filters

Return a curated list with profile links and details about their work

Example 4: Learning about the sector

You ask: "I'm new to grant writing. What are best practices?"

 

Claude will:

Use Knowledge Search targeting Candid learning and Candid Help sources

Provide expert guidance from Candid's training materials

Link to relevant articles and video transcripts for deeper learning

 

Tips for best results
Be specific with locations

When searching for organizations, specific location information helps narrow results:

✅ "nonprofits in Brooklyn, New York"

✅ "foundations serving rural Montana communities"

❌ "organizations in the Northeast" (too broad)

Describe work, not just keywords

The search tools understand descriptions of work, not just keywords:

✅ "organizations helping homeless youth find permanent housing"

✅ "funders supporting immigrant and refugee integration programs"

✅ "nonprofits providing mental health services to veterans"

Combine filters for precision
You can request multiple filters at once:

"Environmental organizations in California with BIPOC leadership"

"Healthcare nonprofits in Texas with Platinum transparency seals"

Ask follow-up questions

Once you have results, dig deeper:

"Tell me more about [organization name]"

"What is this organization's mission?"

"Are there similar organizations in other states?"

Use knowledge search for context

Before diving into organizational data, get context:

"What should I know about funding for affordable housing?"

"What are current best practices in nonprofit board governance?"

Be careful with analytical questions

The current tool is designed for searching about specific organizations or general sector knowledge. It does not currently directly support questions involving calculations, aggregations, or analysis like:

"Which nonprofits received the 3 largest grants for community healthcare in 2023?”

“What was the % change in funding from these grant providers in the last 5 years?”

Claude may still try to answer these questions, but it may not be fully accurate. We are working on supporting such questions directly in the future - stay tuned! In addition, deeper information on grants funding and trends is always available through Candid's subscription products on candid.org.
