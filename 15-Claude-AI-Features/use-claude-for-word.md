# Use Claude for Word

Copy pageCopy page

A Word add-in that integrates Claude into your document workflow, for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.

Copy pageCopy page

Claude for Word is an add-in that brings Claude into Word. Ask questions about your document with clickable section citations, edit selected passages while preserving formatting, review counterparty redlines, work through comment threads, and fill templates in your document’s styles.

Claude for Word is generally available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.


[​](#what-you-can-do)

What you can do

With Claude for Word, you can:

[​](#get-started-with-claude-for-word)

Get started with Claude for Word


[​](#supported-versions)

Supported versions

Claude for Word runs on the following Word builds.

- Word on the web
- Word on Windows with a Microsoft 365 subscription, Version 2205, build 15202.10000 or later
- Word on Mac, version 16.61, build 22040100 or later


[​](#install-for-yourself)

Install for yourself

1

Open the marketplace listing

Go to the [Claude for Microsoft 365 listing on Microsoft AppSource](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200010725?tab=Overview).

2

Install the add-in

Select “Get it now” to install.

3

Sign in

Open Word, activate the add-in, and sign in with your Claude account.


[​](#deploy-to-your-organization)

Deploy to your organization

Organization admins can deploy Claude for Word through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

1

Allow Office Store access

In the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to Settings, Org Settings, User owned apps and services, and turn on [“Let users access the Office Store”](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).

2

Open Integrated apps

Go to Settings, Integrated apps, Add-ins.

3

Find the add-in

Search for “Claude for Microsoft 365” in Microsoft AppSource.

4

Deploy

Assign the add-in to your organization or to specific users or groups. Share [Microsoft’s deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins) with your team for activation steps.

If your organization uses Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for admin roles, the Integrated apps page does not recognize roles activated through PIM, so deployment fails. This is a [known Microsoft issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/resources/resources-office-add-in-known-issues), tracking ID 11126536. To work around it, deploy from an admin account with the required role assigned as permanently active rather than PIM-eligible. See [Microsoft’s troubleshooting guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoft-365/admin/miscellaneous/cannot-deploy-add-in-integrated-apps-menu). Individual users can still [install the add-in themselves](#install-for-yourself).

After deployment, users can activate the Claude add-in from Tools, Add-ins on Mac or Home, Add-ins on Windows, sign in, and start working.

Organizations that have disabled “Let users access the Office Store” may find that admin-deployed add-ins don’t appear for users. To work around this, deploy using the manifest XML file described below.


[​](#deploy-with-a-custom-manifest)

Deploy with a custom manifest

For IT administrators deploying to multiple users when the Office Store is disabled:

1

Download the manifest

Download the [custom manifest XML file](https://pivot.claude.ai/manifest-word.xml) and save it to a secure location.

2

Open the Admin Center

Go to [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), sign in, and open Settings, Integrated apps.

3

Upload the custom add-in

Select “Upload custom apps”, choose “Office Add-in”, then “I have a manifest file on this device”. Upload the manifest.

4

Assign users

Choose entire organization, specific users, specific groups, or just yourself for admin testing.

5

Deploy

Review settings and select “Deploy”. The add-in is available within minutes. Full organization rollout can take up to 24 hours.

After deployment, users see Claude in Word’s Home ribbon and sign in with their Claude credentials on first use.


[​](#connect-through-a-third-party-platform)

Connect through a third-party platform

If your organization routes AI traffic through Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Azure AI Foundry, or an LLM gateway, your admin can deploy the add-in without individual Claude accounts. See [Use Claude for M365 with third-party platforms](https://support.claude.com/docs/office-agents/third-party-platforms).


[​](#key-features)

Key features


[​](#read-and-understand-documents)

Read and understand documents

Ask Claude questions about specific sections, clauses, or defined terms in your document. Claude provides answers with clickable citations that navigate directly to the referenced section.

Claude recognizes common document patterns including multi-level legal numbering, defined terms, cross-references, and standard contract structures. Verify that outputs match your specific requirements and your firm’s standard positions.

Example prompts:

- “What’s the liability cap and is it mutual?”
- “Summarize the key commercial terms in this agreement.”
- “What assumptions drive the revenue forecast in section 3?”


[​](#edit-selected-text)

Edit selected text

Select a passage and tell Claude what to change. Claude edits only the selection while preserving surrounding styles, numbering, and formatting. New text inherits the paragraph style, font, and numbering of the surrounding content. Example prompts:

- “Tighten this paragraph and drop the passive voice.”
- “Rewrite this clause to make the indemnification mutual.”
- “Simplify this section for a non-technical audience.”


[​](#tracked-changes-mode)

Tracked changes mode

When you enter tracked changes mode, Claude’s edits land as tracked revisions. The original text is visible as a deletion and the new text as an insertion, all reviewable in Word’s native review pane. Review every edit before accepting it, and undo with Word’s standard Ctrl+Z on Windows or Cmd+Z on Mac if you want to revert. Example prompts:

- “Rewrite section 4.2 to cap damages at 12 months of fees, and make it mutual.”
- “Draft a mutual indemnification clause after section 8.”


[​](#comment-driven-editing)

Comment-driven editing

Claude reads comment threads in your document, understands what text each thread is anchored to, and can work through them one by one. For each comment, Claude edits the anchored passage and replies to the thread with a note explaining what it did. Example prompts:

- “Work through my open comments.”
- “Address the comment on the liability section.”


[​](#summarize-counterparty-redlines)

Summarize counterparty redlines

When a counterparty returns a document with tracked changes, Claude can read and summarize what they changed. Ask Claude to group changes by severity or flag the ones worth pushing back on. Example prompts:

- “Summarize what the other side changed and flag anything that’s worth discussing.”
- “Which of these redlines are dealbreakers?”


[​](#fill-templates)

Fill templates

Draft sections in your document’s heading and paragraph styles. Claude uses your template’s formatting when generating content, so new headings, bullets, and table entries match what’s already there. Tables populate in place without reflowing layout or changing column widths. Example prompts:

- “Draft the Key Risks section with four risks in the template’s style.”
- “Populate the summary table with revenue, gross margin, and net retention for the last three years.”


[​](#semantic-navigation)

Semantic navigation

Find every provision or passage in your document that touches a specific theme. Claude returns thematic matches, not just keyword hits, and each result navigates to the relevant location on click. Example prompts:

- “Find every provision touching data retention.”
- “Where does this agreement address termination?”


[​](#connectors-and-skills)

Connectors and Skills

Claude for Word supports connectors for pulling external context into your document, and Skills for applying reusable task recipes. See [Connectors and Skills](https://support.claude.com/docs/office-agents/connectors-and-skills) for details.


[​](#set-persistent-instructions)

Set persistent instructions

Open Settings in the add-in sidebar and use the Instructions field to set preferences that apply to every conversation in Word. Instructions are useful for tone and style conventions such as “use formal tone” or “follow APA citation style”, document structure preferences, or recurring context about your workflow. Instructions you set in Word only apply to Word. They are separate from Instructions you set in Excel or PowerPoint.


[​](#work-across-m365-apps)

Work across M365 apps

Claude for Word shares context with Claude for Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, so a single conversation can span your open document, workbook, deck, and inbox. See [Work across M365 apps](https://support.claude.com/docs/office-agents/work-across-apps).


[​](#context-and-session-management)

Context and session management

The add-in handles long sessions for you so a single conversation can span an entire workflow.

- **Auto-compaction**: longer conversations are automatically compacted into new conversations to avoid running out of context. See [Understanding usage and length limits](../22-Safety-Policy/understanding-usage-and-length-limits.md).

Your use of Claude for Word is associated with your existing Claude account and is subject to the same usage limits.


[​](#models-available)

Models available

Claude for M365 offers a curated subset of the Claude models: the ones that work best for Office tasks, so the list you see in the add-in can be shorter than what you see in Claude.ai. Your organization’s model access settings also apply, and a model appears here only if your role permits it. See [Manage model access for your organization](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15694740-manage-model-access-for-your-organization) for how those settings interact with each product. If you connect through Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Azure AI Foundry, or an LLM gateway, the available models come from that platform and your admin’s configuration instead of your Claude.ai model access settings. See [Use Claude for M365 with third-party platforms](https://support.claude.com/docs/office-agents/third-party-platforms) for details.


[​](#data-handling)

Data handling

Inputs and outputs are deleted on the backend within 30 days of receipt or generation, except in cases outlined in [How long do you store my organization’s data?](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data). Data is cached for a number of hours after deletion so users can access context in recently closed documents. Chat history is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. Conversations are not stored on Anthropic’s servers, are not synced across devices, and can be cleared from Settings at any time. Reinstalling the add-in or switching between Claude add-ins does not remove it. See [Data storage and retention](https://support.claude.com/docs/office-agents/data-storage) for where it sits on disk and how long it is kept. Claude for Word does not inherit custom data retention settings your organization might have set. Activity is not included in Enterprise audit logs. For Enterprise organizations with the [Compliance API](../04-API-Reference/Other/manage-claude-compliance-api.md) enabled, Claude for Word sessions are included in the Compliance API. This coverage is in public beta and requires no additional setup: the same Compliance Access Keys apply. Claude reads the content of your currently open document, including text, comments, tracked changes, footnotes, tables, and bookmarks. It only accesses the document you have open in Word. For highly sensitive or regulated data, follow your organization’s data handling policies.


[​](#current-limitations)

Current limitations

Claude for Word is not recommended for:

- Final client deliverables or counterparty sends without human review.
- Litigation filings or audit-critical documents without verification.
- Replacing legal or financial judgment.
- Documents containing highly sensitive or privileged data without proper controls.


[​](#unsupported-versions)

Unsupported versions

The add-in does not run on these Word versions.

- Word 2016 and 2019 perpetual or volume license.
- Word on iPad.
- Word on Android.
- Microsoft 365 Word builds older than Version 2205 on Windows or version 16.61 on Mac.
- Legacy `.doc` files. Save as `.docx` first.


[​](#prompt-injection-risk)

Prompt injection risk

Only use Claude for Word with trusted documents. Documents from external sources such as downloaded templates, counterparty files, or files shared via email can contain hidden instructions that manipulate the add-in into extracting data, modifying records, or performing destructive actions.

Prompt injection attacks hide malicious instructions in document content such as text, comments, tracked changes, headers, and footers to trick Claude into taking unintended actions. Testing has identified scenarios where Claude for Word can be manipulated to:

- Extract and share sensitive information through web searches containing your sensitive data or file system access that exposes proprietary information.
- Modify critical content such as contract terms or financial figures.
- Perform destructive actions without verification when allowed to act unsupervised.

When Claude proposes a risky operation, you are asked to confirm before it runs. Review confirmations carefully, especially for content from external sources.


[​](#best-practices)

Best practices

Follow these guidelines to use Claude for Word safely and effectively.

- Always review tracked changes before accepting them.
- Verify that outputs match your firm’s playbook and standard positions.
- Use appropriate permissions and access controls.
