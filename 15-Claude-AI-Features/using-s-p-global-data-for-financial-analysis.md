Historical price analysis using S&P Global data goes beyond simple price charts. Claude can calculate risk metrics like volatility and maximum drawdown while comparing performance to benchmarks. Using adjusted prices ensures that return calculations properly account for corporate actions, providing accurate performance measurement over multi-year periods.

**When to use:** Evaluating historical risk-return profiles or backtesting investment strategies.

**Note:** Adjusted prices ensure accurate return calculations across corporate actions like splits and special dividends, which is essential for long-term performance analysis.

### Financial Statement Deep Dive[](#financial-statement-deep-dive)

Financial statement analysis through Kensho allows examination of margin trends and cost structure evolution over time. Claude can pull specific line items from S&P Global datasets across multiple quarters, calculate relevant ratios, and apply smoothing techniques to identify underlying trends beyond seasonal fluctuations. This granular approach reveals operational changes that might be obscured in annual reports.

**When to use:** Analyzing margin trends, cost structure changes, or earnings quality.

**Tip:** LTM calculations help normalize for seasonal businesses, providing clearer trend analysis for companies with significant quarterly variations.

### Competitor Benchmarking[](#competitor-benchmarking)

Competitor analysis combines Kensho's relationship mapping with financial metric comparisons. Claude first identifies competitors from various sources, then retrieves comparable metrics for each company. This approach provides both the competitive landscape view and quantitative performance comparisons, helping assess relative positioning and competitive advantages.

**When to use:** Industry analysis or relative valuation work.

**Note:** Different source filters provide varying perspectives on competition—SEC filings show who companies view as threats, while third-party sources may identify less obvious competitive dynamics.

### Segment Performance Tracking[](#segment-performance-tracking)
