Projects are available to all users, including those with free Claude accounts. Free users can create a maximum of five projects.

Projects allow you to create self-contained workspaces with their own chat histories and knowledge bases. Within each project, you can upload documents, provide context, and have focused chats with Claude.

 

Project Knowledge

A key benefit of projects is the ability to provide context for your chats with Claude. You can upload relevant documents, text, code, or other files to a project's knowledge base, which Claude will use to better understand the context and background for your individual chats within that project.

 

In addition, you can define project instructions for each project to further tailor Claude's responses. For example, instructing Claude to use a more formal tone or answer questions from the perspective of a specific role or industry.

 

Enhanced project knowledge with RAG

Enhanced project knowledge with RAG is only available to users with paid Claude plans (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise).

When using a paid plan, your projects automatically scale to handle large amounts of content through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). When your project knowledge approaches context limits, Claude seamlessly enables RAG mode to expand capacity by up to 10x while maintaining response quality.

 

For more information on leveraging expanded project knowledge capacity, see Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Projects.

 

Collaboration and Sharing (Team and Enterprise plans only)

For users on Claude for Work (Team and Enterprise) plans, projects can be shared with other members of your organization, enabling powerful collaboration and knowledge sharing capabilities. The sharing system includes:

 

Permission levels:

Can use: Members can see project contents, knowledge, and instructions, and chat within the project, but cannot edit it.

Can edit: Members can modify project instructions and knowledge, add/remove members, update member settings, and actively contribute to the project.

Project creators can:

Share to specific members instead of making a project fully private or public to the entire organization.

Make a previously-created private project visible to the whole organization.

Sharing options:

Individual sharing: Share projects with specific team members by email.

Bulk sharing: Add multiple users at once using email lists.

Organization-wide sharing: Make projects available to everyone in your organization either when creating the project or afterward.

Note: If an Owner or Primary Owner disables public projects, organization-wide sharing will be disabled both when creating the project and afterward.

Collaboration features:

Shared with me tab: Easily find projects that others have shared with you.

Email notifications: Get notified when someone shares a project with you.

Access management: Project creators can modify permissions or remove access as needed.

Multiple members can contribute documents, create chats, and work together within the same project environment, making projects ideal for team collaboration.
