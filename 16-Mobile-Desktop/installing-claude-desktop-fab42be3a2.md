Desktop extensions transform how you connect Claude to your desktop applications and data. Similar to browser extensions, these secure, installable packages let you:

Connect Claude to your desktop apps with one click: Install extensions that integrate with your local files, calendars, emails, and messaging apps.

Access a curated directory of extensions: Browse verified extensions directly within Claude Desktop, including options like iMessage and filesystem access.

Enjoy enterprise-ready security: Extensions use code signing, encrypted storage for sensitive data like API keys, and enterprise policy controls.

To explore desktop extensions, navigate to Settings > Extensions within the Claude Desktop app after installation.

Note: We’re building a directory of desktop extensions – if you’re a developer hoping to add an extension you built to the directory, complete our desktop extensions interest form to share more information with us.
