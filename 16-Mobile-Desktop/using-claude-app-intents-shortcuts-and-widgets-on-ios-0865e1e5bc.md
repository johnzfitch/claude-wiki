The features described in this guide are available on iOS 18 and above.

Claude for iOS supports multiple powerful features: the Claude widget, the "Analyze Photo with Claude" control, the "Ask Claude" App Intent, and the ability to use this intent within iOS Shortcuts. This guide will explain these features and show you how to make the most of them.

 

Ask Claude Intent

The "Ask Claude" intent is a standalone feature that lets you interact with Claude directly from:

Spotlight search

Siri

The Share menu

Any app that supports iOS intents

You can use this intent on its own to quickly ask Claude questions or give it tasks without opening the Claude app. For example, you can:

Select text and use the Share menu to send it directly to Claude

Ask Siri to "Ask Claude” and it will prompt you for a message 

Type "Ask Claude" in Spotlight search to quickly send a query

 

Using Ask Claude With Shortcuts 

While the "Ask Claude" intent is powerful on its own, you can also use it as a building block within the Shortcuts app to create more complex workflows. Shortcuts allow you to:

Chain multiple "Ask Claude" actions together

Combine Claude's capabilities with other apps and actions

Create automated workflows

Process Claude's responses in various ways

 

Creating Your First Claude Shortcut

There are many customizable workflows you can set up within the Shortcuts app. Let's look at an example of a brief but useful shortcut that helps you summarize text:

Open the Shortcuts app on your iOS device

Tap the "+" button to create a new shortcut

Add the "Share" action and select your preferred input type

Add the "Ask Claude" action

In the "Ask Claude" action, create a prompt like: "Please summarize the following text: [Shortcut Input]"

Name your shortcut (e.g., "Summarize with Claude")

Optional: Add the shortcut to your Share Sheet for easy access

Now you can select text anywhere in iOS, tap the Share button, and choose your "Summarize with Claude" shortcut to get an instant summary.

 

When using "Ask Claude" intent and in shortcuts, the default model you see when opening the Claude app will be used.

 

More information on setting up shortcuts on your iOS device can be found here.

Note: When using the "Ask Claude" intent, messages to Claude will count towards your overall usage limit.

The Claude widget provides quick access to chat and voice features directly from your Home Screen or Today View. The widget includes buttons for:

The Analyze Photo with Claude Control

The "Analyze Photo with Claude" control lets you quickly send images to Claude for analysis directly from Control Center or your Lock Screen.

Adding to Your Lock Screen

On your Lock Screen, touch and hold until the customization screen appears

Tap "Customize"

Select the lock screen you want to modify
