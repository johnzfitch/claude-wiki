The features described in this guide are available on iOS 18 and above.

Claude for iOS supports multiple powerful features: the Claude widget, the "Analyze Photo with Claude" control, the "Ask Claude" App Intent, and the ability to use this intent within iOS Shortcuts. This guide will explain these features and show you how to make the most of them.

## Ask Claude Intent

The "Ask Claude" intent is a standalone feature that lets you interact with Claude directly from:

- Spotlight search

- Siri

- The Share menu

- Any app that supports iOS intents

You can use this intent on its own to quickly ask Claude questions or give it tasks without opening the Claude app. For example, you can:

- Select text and use the Share menu to send it directly to Claude

- Ask Siri to "Ask Claude” and it will prompt you for a message

- Type "Ask Claude" in Spotlight search to quickly send a query

## Using Ask Claude With Shortcuts

While the "Ask Claude" intent is powerful on its own, you can also use it as a building block within the Shortcuts app to create more complex workflows. Shortcuts allow you to:

- Chain multiple "Ask Claude" actions together

- Combine Claude's capabilities with other apps and actions

- Create automated workflows

- Process Claude's responses in various ways

## Creating Your First Claude Shortcut

There are many customizable workflows you can set up within the Shortcuts app. Let's look at an example of a brief but useful shortcut that helps you summarize text:

1.  Open the Shortcuts app on your iOS device

2.  Tap the "+" button to create a new shortcut

3.  Add the "Share" action and select your preferred input type

4.  Add the "Ask Claude" action

5.  In the "Ask Claude" action, create a prompt like: "Please summarize the following text: \[Shortcut Input\]"

6.  Name your shortcut (e.g., "Summarize with Claude")

7.  Optional: Add the shortcut to your Share Sheet for easy access

Now you can select text anywhere in iOS, tap the Share button, and choose your "Summarize with Claude" shortcut to get an instant summary.

When using "Ask Claude" intent and in shortcuts, the default model you see when opening the Claude app will be used.

More information on setting up shortcuts on your iOS device can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios).

**Note:** When using the "Ask Claude" intent, messages to Claude will count towards your overall usage limit.

## Adding the Claude Widget

The Claude widget provides quick access to chat and voice features directly from your Home Screen or Today View. The widget includes buttons for:

- Starting a new chat

- Instantly opening the app in dictation mode

- Taking a photo to share with Claude

### Add the Claude widget to your Home Screen

1.  From the Home Screen, touch and hold a widget or an empty area until the apps jiggle

2.  Tap Edit in the upper-left corner

3.  Tap Add Widget

4.  Search for and select Claude

5.  Tap Add Widget

6.  Tap Done

### To add the Claude widget to your Today View

Swipe right from the Home Screen or Lock Screen, then follow the same steps as adding to the Home Screen.

### Using the Widget

- Tap the chat button to start a new conversation with Claude.

- Tap the microphone button to instantly open the app in dictation mode, allowing you to start speaking to Claude right away.

- Tap the camera button to take a photo and share it with Claude for analysis.

**Note:** Like the "Ask Claude" intent, interactions started through the widget will count toward your usage limit.

## The Analyze Photo with Claude Control

The "Analyze Photo with Claude" control lets you quickly send images to Claude for analysis directly from Control Center or your Lock Screen.

### Adding to Control Center

1.  Open Control Center (swipe down from the top-right corner on iPhones with Face ID, or swipe up from the bottom on iPhones with a Home button)

2.  Tap the Add button (plus sign) at the top left of Control Center to begin editing

3.  Tap "Add a Control" at the bottom of the screen to open the controls gallery

4.  Find and tap "Analyze Photo with Claude" to add it to Control Center

5.  You can rearrange its position by dragging it to your preferred location

6.  When finished, close Control Center by swiping up from the bottom center of the screen

Once added, you can quickly access it from Control Center by swiping down from the top-right corner of the screen.

More information on using and setting up controls via Control Center can be found [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-and-customize-control-center-iph59095ec58/ios).

### Adding to Your Lock Screen

1.  On your Lock Screen, touch and hold until the customization screen appears

2.  Tap "Customize"

3.  Select the lock screen you want to modify

4.  Remove one of the controls at the bottom of the screen using the Remove button (minus sign), then tap the Add button (plus sign) to open the controls gallery

5.  From the available controls menu, scroll or search for "Analyze Photo with Claude"

6.  Tap to select it

7.  Tap "Done" to save your changes

You can now quickly access the "Analyze Photo with Claude" control without needing to unlock your device or open the Claude app first.
