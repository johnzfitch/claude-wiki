The Claude Android widget is available on Android 8.0 Oreo and above.

The Claude Android widget provides quick and convenient access to core features directly from your home screen, allowing you to start new chats, capture images, and use voice dictation with a single tap.

## Adding the Claude Widget

The Claude widget puts Claude's key features right on your home screen. To add it:

1.  Touch and hold an empty area on your home screen

2.  Tap "Widgets"

3.  Find and tap "Claude"

4.  Drag the widget to your desired location

5.  Release to place it

6.  Optional: Drag the edges of the widget to resize it

## Widget Features

The widget offers three quick-access buttons:

- A primary chat button (with Claude's spark icon) to start a new conversation

- A camera button for capturing and sharing images with Claude

- A microphone button for voice dictation

## Using the Widget

### Starting a Chat

Tap the main chat button (with the spark icon) to instantly start a new conversation with Claude.

### Taking Photos

Tap the camera button to start a new chat and immediately open your camera. You can capture an image and share it with Claude for analysis.

### Voice Dictation

Tap the microphone button to start a new chat and begin voice dictation. The first time you use this feature, you'll see a brief explanation about how automatic recording works. You may also need to grant voice permissions if you haven't already done so.

**Note:** All interactions started through the widget will count toward your usage limit.
