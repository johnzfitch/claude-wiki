Voice mode is a beta feature available in English to all plans for Claude mobile apps.

Voice mode allows you to have complete spoken conversations with Claude on your iOS and Android devices. This feature enables you to speak to Claude and hear responses through voice, making it easier to use Claude when your hands are busy but your mind isn't.

## What is voice mode?

Voice mode transforms how you interact with Claude by:

- Allowing you to speak to Claude and hear Claude's voice responses

- Displaying key points on-screen as Claude speaks

- Seamlessly switch between text and voice within the same conversation

- (For paid users) Providing access to your Google Docs, Calendar, Gmail, and web searches through voice conversations

## Getting started with voice mode

### Accessing voice mode

1.  Open the Claude mobile app on your iOS or Android device.

2.  Tap the voice mode icon (sound wave symbol next to the microphone icon) located in the text input field.

3.  Choose from distinct voice options to personalize your experience.

4.  Speak to begin your conversation with Claude.

## Best practices for voice mode

### Optimal Environments

- Use voice mode in environments with minimal background noise for best recognition.

- Ensure your device has sufficient battery life, as voice processing may use more power.

### Clear Communication

- Speak naturally and at a normal pace.

- Claude responds to natural pauses in your speech.

- For complex queries, consider breaking them into separate questions.

### Switching Between Modes

- You can seamlessly switch between text and voice within the same conversation.

- Previous context is maintained when switching modes.

## Common Use Cases

Voice mode is particularly useful for:

- **Daily Planning:** Start your day with Claude briefing you on upcoming meetings, important emails, and relevant news while you prepare for the day.

- **Learning:** Explore new topics through conversation while commuting, exercising, or completing household tasks.

- **Creative Thinking:** Think out loud with Claude, using conversation to develop ideas when typing would slow down your thought process.

- **Preparation:** Practice for interviews or important discussions by engaging in natural dialogue with Claude.

- **Capturing Ideas:** Record and develop thoughts exactly when they occur, no matter where you are or what you're doing.

## Usage Limits and Availability

- Voice mode is currently available in English on Claude mobile apps.

- Voice conversations count toward your regular usage limits based on your subscription plan.

- For free users, expect approximately 20-30 voice messages before reaching session [limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8602283-does-claude-ai-have-any-message-limits).

- For paid plans, [usage limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8325612-does-claude-pro-have-any-usage-limits) are significantly higher, allowing for extended voice conversations.

- Google Calendar information

- Gmail content

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I change Claude's voice?**

You can select from five voice options when you first activate voice mode. To change the voice later, go to Settings \> Voice Preferences.

**Will my voice chat transcripts be saved?**

Yes, chat transcripts and summarized voice notes are saved in your chat history just like text conversations.

**What’s the difference between dictation and voice mode?**

Dictation allows you to speak your prompts instead of typing them when using Claude on mobile apps. Voice mode expands dictation so you can talk to Claude, and Claude can talk back.

**Can Enterprise Admins disable voice mode for their organizations?**

If you are an Enterprise Admin and would like to disable voice mode for your organization, please reach out to Support.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude isn't recognizing my voice correctly

- Ensure you're in a quiet environment with minimal background noise.

- Speak clearly and at a normal pace.

- Check that your device's microphone permissions are enabled for the Claude app.

### Voice responses sound choppy or cut out

- Check your internet connection stability.

- Ensure your device has sufficient battery power.

- Close other apps that might be using significant system resources.

### Claude stops responding in voice mode

- Check your usage limits to see if you've reached your daily limit.

- Restart the app and try again.

- Ensure your internet connection is stable.

## Safety Measures in voice mode

Voice mode has been developed with safety as a top priority. Several safeguards have been implemented to mitigate potential risks:

- **Limited Voice Options:** Choose from a preset, limited selection of voices. This prevents voice cloning or impersonation. The system is designed specifically to avoid mimicking specific individuals or personalizing voice outputs.

- **Generative by Design**: Claude is designed to generate original responses rather than reproduce text exactly or mimic specific speech patterns, which prevents impersonation.

- **Full Policy Compliance:** Our usage policy remains fully enforced in voice mode, with all standard model misuse detection and enforcement systems actively monitoring interactions.
