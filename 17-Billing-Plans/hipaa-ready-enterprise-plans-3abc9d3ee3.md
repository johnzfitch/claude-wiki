This feature is available for Enterprise plans only.

We now offer a HIPAA-ready version of Claude that is available for organizations with Enterprise plans that choose to process protected health information (PHI) through Claude. This article explains what the offering includes, which features are available, and how to get started.

 

Overview

The HIPAA-ready Enterprise offering is designed for healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare data processors, and their business associates who are subject to HIPAA requirements. This offering includes a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), functionality, and safeguards designed to support an organization's HIPAA compliance requirements.

 

Who is this for?

This offering is designed for HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates, including:

Healthcare providers (e.g., hospitals, clinics, physicians)

Health plans and insurers

Healthcare data processors

Business associates that handle PHI on behalf of covered entities

Other HIPAA regulated entities

If you're unsure whether your organization benefits from a HIPAA-ready product, ask yourself: will you be processing protected health information through Claude? If yes, you need the HIPAA-ready offering with a BAA.

 

Plan availability

The HIPAA-ready offering is available exclusively for Enterprise plan customers. 

 

Feature availability

The HIPAA-ready Enterprise offering includes access to most of the features available on standard Enterprise plans. For example, users can chat with Claude, create projects and artifacts, and use voice mode. Depending on what functions are enabled by the organization’s plan administrator, users can also leverage connectors, enterprise search, file creation and code execution, web search, research, and skills. More information about the specific features, functionality, and administrator controls are included in the Implementation Guide for HIPAA Entities.

Important: Claude Code bundled seats are not currently covered as part of the HIPAA-ready offering. If you purchase Enterprise seats that include Claude Code access, only the chat functionality is covered. Claude Code usage is not covered, even when purchased as part of a bundled seat. If your organization wants to have Claude Code usage covered as part of HIPAA-related services, contact your account team to discuss available options.

 

Additional resources

For detailed implementation requirements and technical specifications, review the Implementation Guide for HIPAA Entities on the Anthropic Trust Center.

Note: You'll need to request access to view the Implementation Guide. Requests from domains matching existing customer accounts are approved automatically.

 

Getting started

The HIPAA-ready offering for Enterprise plans requires an organization to execute a BAA and is not available through self-service. To get started:

Contact our sales team to discuss your organization's needs.

Review the Business Associate Agreement and the Implementation Guide.

Execute the Business Associate Agreement.

Work with your account team to appropriately set up and configure your HIPAA-ready Enterprise plan.

 

If you have an existing API BAA

If your organization signed a BAA for Claude API usage before December 2, 2025, that agreement only covers API usage—it does not extend to the HIPAA-ready Enterprise plan. To add this Enterprise plan access, you'll need to sign a new BAA with your account team.

 

BAAs signed after December 2, 2025 can cover both API usage and the Enterprise plan under a single agreement.
