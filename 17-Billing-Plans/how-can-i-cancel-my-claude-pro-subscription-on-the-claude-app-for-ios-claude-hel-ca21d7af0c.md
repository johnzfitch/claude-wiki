How can I cancel my Claude Pro subscription on the Claude app for iOS?

# How can I cancel my Claude Pro subscription on the Claude app for iOS?

Updated this week

If you signed up for Claude Pro via the iOS app, your subscription and payment will be handled directly on your iOS device.

To cancel your subscription, click on your initials in the top right corner of the Claude app for iOS, and then click “Billing” from the menu options. Select “manage subscription” and follow the prompts for cancellation. If you’ve already removed the app from your device, you can also follow the instructions located in the App Store resource [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118428) to unsubscribe.

You may cancel your Claude Pro subscription at any time from the platform you signed up on. To avoid being charged for your next billing period, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before your next billing date.
