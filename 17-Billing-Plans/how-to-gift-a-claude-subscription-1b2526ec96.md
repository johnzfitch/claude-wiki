Who can purchase gifts?

Anyone can purchase a gift subscription, so you don’t need to have a Claude account to give a subscription to someone else.

 

How to purchase a gift

Log in to your Claude account and click your initials in the lower left corner.

Select “Gift Claude” from the menu, or visit claude.ai/gift.

Choose a plan (Pro, Max 5x, or Max 20x) and duration (1, 3, 6, or 12 months).

Personalize your gift:

Pick a card color

Add an optional message

Choose to send via email or generate a shareable link

If sending by email, enter the recipient's name and email address.

Complete checkout with your payment information.

After purchase, you'll receive a confirmation email with your order details.

Important: The gift will expire 365 days after the purchase date. Recipients cannot redeem multiple gifts at one time or stack redemptions.

 

Delivery Options

Email delivery: The recipient receives the gift directly in their inbox. The email includes your personalized message and a redemption button.

 

Shareable link: You receive a link that you can share however you'd like—in a card, text message, or in person.

 

Good to Know

Gift subscriptions are available globally.

Recipients redeem gifts on the web at claude.ai/gift/redeem.

Recipients with active mobile (iOS or Android) subscriptions will need to wait until their mobile subscription ends before redeeming.

No credit card is required for the recipient to redeem.
