Someone sent you a Claude gift subscription—here's how to redeem it and start using Claude.

 

How to redeem your gift

Open the gift email or link you received.

Click “Redeem your gift.”

Sign in to your Claude account, or create a new account if you don't have one.

Confirm redemption.

You can also redeem directly at claude.ai/gift/redeem and enter your gift code.

Important: Your gift will expire 365 days after the purchase date. It’s not possible to redeem multiple gifts at one time or stack redemptions.

 

What happens when you redeem

Your experience depends on your current subscription status:

 

If you're a new or free user: Your account is upgraded to the gifted plan immediately. You'll have full access for the duration of the gift.

 

If you're a Pro subscriber (web) and receive a Pro gift: Your Pro subscription is extended by the gift duration.

 

If you're a Pro subscriber (web) and receive a Max gift: You're upgraded to the Max plan for the gift duration. When the gift ends, your Pro subscription resumes. Any unused time from your Pro billing cycle is added as account credit.

 

If you're a Max subscriber (web) and receive a lower-tier gift: The gift value is converted to account credit, which is automatically applied to your future invoices.

 

If you're a Max subscriber (web) and receive the same or higher Max tier: Your Max subscription is extended or upgraded accordingly.

 

Mobile Subscribers

If you have an active subscription through the iOS App Store or Google Play Store, you'll need to wait until that subscription ends before you can redeem a gift subscription. Gift subscriptions can only be redeemed on the web.

Your gift won't expire while you wait—you can redeem it once your mobile subscription ends.

 

Troubleshooting
I don't see the redemption email

Check your spam or junk folder. If you still can't find it, ask the person who sent the gift to confirm your email address or resend the gift link.

 

I'm getting an error when trying to redeem

Make sure you're signed in to Claude on the web (not the mobile app).

 

Can I use the gift on a different email address?

The gift can be redeemed by any Claude account, regardless of which email received the gift.
