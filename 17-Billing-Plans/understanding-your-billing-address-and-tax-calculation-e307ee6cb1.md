Your billing address determines how taxes are calculated on your Claude purchases. This address should represent the primary place of business receiving the product.

 

How billing addresses work by plan type
Pro, Max, and self-serve Team plans

Your billing address is automatically set to match your payment method's billing address. To update it, navigate to Settings > Billing and click “Update” to the right of your current payment method.

 

Sales-assisted Team plans and Enterprise plans

You can update your billing address directly in Settings → Billing → Billing Addresses. Changes take effect immediately for future invoices.

 

API (usage tier 1-4 / self-serve)

Your billing address is tied to your payment method. Update your payment method by navigating to Settings > Billing in the Claude Console and clicking the pencil icon to the right of your current card number to change your billing address.

 

Paid API contracts

You can update your billing address directly in the Claude Console under Settings → Billing → Billing Addresses.

 

Requesting a different billing address

If you need a billing address that differs from your payment method address, contact our Support team with documentation verifying your primary business location:

Non-US customers: VAT registration certificate matching your requested location

US customers: State of incorporation, business license, or tax ID documentation

Once verified, your billing address won't automatically update when you change payment methods.
