This article is about paid Max plans for individual consumers. If you're part of an organization looking to use Claude with your team, refer to **[Team and Enterprise Plans](https://support.claude.com/en/collections/9387370-team-and-enterprise-plans)**.

The Max plan is designed for users who collaborate with Claude frequently and need more usage to work on a variety of tasks. In addition to providing higher usage limits than the Pro plan, Max plan subscribers will also receive priority access to our newest features and models.

## Key benefits

- **More usage capacity**: Get 5x or 20x more usage than the Pro plan, depending on your selected tier.

- **No more interruptions**: Stay in flow when it matters most with higher usage limits that allow for deeper, more extensive work with Claude.

- **Scale as needed**: Choose the usage tier that matches your workflow, with the flexibility to adjust as your needs change.

- **Priority access**: Be among the first to experience new models, features, and products.

- **Access to Claude Code: [Use Claude Code](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan)** for your terminal-based coding workflows with one unified subscription.

- **Cowork (research preview):** Hand off complex, multi-step tasks to Claude in Claude Desktop (on macOS only). Claude can access your local files, coordinate parallel workstreams, and deliver professional outputs like spreadsheets and presentations. See this article for more information: **[Getting Started with Cowork](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13345190-getting-started-with-local-agent-mode)**.

## How much does the Max plan cost?

### Pricing tiers

The Max plan is available in two tiers to match your usage needs:

- **Max 5x**: \$100 per month

- **Max 20x**: \$200 per month

**Note:** These prices are for web subscriptions only. Mobile pricing may vary depending on your app platform.

### Billing information

- The Max plan is currently available as a monthly subscription only.

- When upgrading from a lower to a higher tier, your account will be charged on a prorated basis for the remainder of your billing cycle.

- When moving from an annual Pro plan to a Max plan, if the remaining balance on your annual Pro plan is greater than your Max plan price, you will receive a credit to your account for the remaining balance. This credit will be applied to future subscription costs.

  - To receive your credit, the billing address used to purchase your Max plan must be the same as your previous subscription’s billing address.

  - If your billing address has changed, you will need to cancel your Pro subscription and wait for the subscription end date before signing up for a new Max subscription with a new billing address.

### How can I get a free or discounted Max plan?

We do not offer standard discounted pricing any of our paid plans, including Max 5x and 20x plans. With that said, anyone in a supported location can access the free version of Claude by navigating to claude.ai and signing up using an email address.

We occasionally run limited-time promotions, but we don't have any standing discounts available upon request. These promotional offers are typically announced through our official channels when available. If you're interested in potential future promotions, we recommend following our official social media accounts or signing up for our newsletter to be notified of any special offers. Our Support team cannot issue one-off discounts or coupons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Does the Max plan have any usage limits?

Yes. The Max plan offers substantially higher usage compared to our Pro plan and is available in two tiers:

**Max 5x** provides 5 times more usage per session than the Pro plan. This tier is ideal for frequent users who work with Claude on a variety of tasks.

**Max 20x** provides 20 times more usage per session than the Pro plan. This tier is ideal for daily users who collaborate often with Claude for most tasks.

Max plans also have two weekly usage limits: one that applies across all models and another for Sonnet models only. Both limits reset seven days after your session starts.

In addition, to manage capacity and ensure fair access to all users, we may limit your usage in other ways, such as weekly and monthly caps or model and feature usage, at our discretion.

For more information about usage and length limits, refer to **[Understanding usage and length limits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11647753-understanding-usage-and-length-limits)**. For guidance on using your Max capacity efficiently, we also have **[Usage limit best practices](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9797557-usage-limit-best-practices)**.
