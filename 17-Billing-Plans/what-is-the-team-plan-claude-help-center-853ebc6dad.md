## Premium seats for Team plans

In addition to all features of Standard seats listed above, Premium seats offer significantly more usage than Standard seats. This makes Premium seats ideal for power users who need extended capacity for demanding workloads.

Organizations can mix and match seat types, assigning Premium seats to power users who need more usage while keeping other team members on Standard seats.

Refer to this article for more information about Premium seats: **[Purchasing and managing seats on Team plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12004354-purchasing-and-managing-seats-on-team-plans)**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How much does the Team plan cost?

Team plans require a minimum of five members. Pricing varies by seat type and billing interval:

**Standard seats**

- \$25 per member per month, billed monthly

- \$20 per member per month, billed annually

**Premium seats**

- \$125 per member per month, billed monthly

- \$100 per member per month, billed annually

Prices shown are for US customers and exclude applicable taxes. Pricing, currency, and tax handling vary by region. Visit **[claude.ai/upgrade](https://claude.ai/upgrade)** to see current pricing for your location.

For more details on billing, see **[How is my Team plan bill calculated?](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9267289-how-is-my-team-plan-bill-calculated)**

Team plans support up to 75 seats. If your organization needs more than 75 seats, consider the **[Enterprise plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9797531-what-is-the-enterprise-plan)**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Do Team plans have any usage limits?

Yes. Usage limits differ between Standard and Premium seats.

**Standard seats:** Team plan Standard seats offer 1.25x more usage per session than the Pro plan and have a weekly usage limit that applies across all models and resets seven days after your session starts.

**Premium seats:** Team plan Premium seats offer 6.25x more usage per session than the Pro plan. Users assigned to these seats ​​also have two weekly usage limits: one that applies across all models and another for Sonnet models only. Both limits reset seven days after your session starts.

### Do usage limits apply across the team or to individual members?

Usage limits on Team plans are per-member, rather than applied to the team as a whole.

\
This means:

- Each team member has their own set of usage limits.

- If one team member reaches their seat's included usage limit, it does not affect the limits of other team members.

- Other team members can continue to use the service even if one member has reached their seat's included limit.

### How do I increase my Team plan usage limits?

Your Team plan organization can enable extra usage to allow team members on all seat types to continue working with Claude and Claude Code after reaching their included usage limits. See this article for more information: **[Extra usage for Team and seat-based Enterprise plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12005970-extra-usage-for-team-and-seat-based-enterprise-plans).**
