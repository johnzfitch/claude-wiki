# Anthropic partners with Menlo Ventures to launch Anthology Fund

Jul 17, 2024

We’re launching the Anthology Fund in partnership with Menlo Ventures to accelerate the development of groundbreaking AI applications. The Fund is a \$100 million initiative financed by Menlo to support startups innovating broadly with Anthropic technology.

“Through our partnership with Menlo Ventures and the Anthology Fund, we hope to accelerate the development of groundbreaking AI applications. We're particularly interested in ventures that leverage AI to enhance human capabilities and productivity in fields such as healthcare, legal services, education, energy, infrastructure, and scientific research,” said Daniela Amodei, co-founder and President of Anthropic. “We look forward to working closely with Menlo and the exceptional founders backed by this Fund to push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI.”

The Fund will back selected entrepreneurs primarily innovating in five key areas: AI infrastructure; novel applications of AI in industries like healthcare, education, scientific research, and more; consumer AI solutions; trust and safety tooling; and AI apps and technology that maximize societal benefits.

Startups backed by the Anthology Fund will gain access to Anthropic products and research, \$25,000 in free credits towards our most advanced models, and best-in-class venture support from Menlo, among other benefits and resources.

“We are thrilled to join forces with Anthropic to launch the Anthology Fund,” said Matt Murphy, Partner at Menlo Ventures. “By combining Menlo’s company-building experience with Anthropic’s cutting-edge AI technology and talent, we are uniquely positioned to identify and partner with the most promising entrepreneurs shaping the future of AI.”  

We look forward to working with Menlo in supporting the startup ecosystem and driving responsible AI innovation.
