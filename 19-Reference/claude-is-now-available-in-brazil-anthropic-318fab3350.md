# Claude is now available in Brazil

Aug 1, 2024

Claude, Anthropic’s trusted AI assistant, is now available in Brazil. Starting today, consumers and businesses in Brazil will be able to access Claude via:

- [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.23b5ab1d-5d08-482a-9a68-3bc96e8fe937): The web-based version of our next-generation AI assistant.
- Claude mobile apps: Free [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anthropic.claude&pli=1) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684) apps, offering an intuitive mobile experience and access to our most powerful model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/api): Enables developers to integrate Anthropic's state-of-the-art AI models into their own applications, websites, or services.

Claude.ai offers both free and paid plans. Paid users on the [Pro plan](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) get 5x more usage versus our Free tier, early access to new features, and access to all our current Claude models—including [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), our most intelligent model yet, and the rest of the Claude 3 family—for R\$ 110 per user per month.

Paid users on the [Team plan](https://www.anthropic.com/team) get even more usage and access to shared chats with teammates for R\$ 165 per user per month, with a minimum of 5 seats. The Team plan includes administrative tools to conveniently control user and billing management for easier onboarding and less overhead.

## Commitment to safety and privacy

Anthropic prioritizes safety, privacy, and ethical AI development in Claude's design. Rigorous testing and training aim to reduce misuse, while a strong commitment to user privacy means generative models are not trained on user data without explicit permission.
