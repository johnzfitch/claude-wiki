# Powering the next generation of AI development with AWS

Nov 22, 2024

Today we’re announcing an expansion of our collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), deepening our work together to develop and deploy advanced AI systems. This expanded partnership includes a new \$4 billion investment from Amazon and establishes AWS as our primary cloud and training partner. This will bring Amazon's total investment in Anthropic to \$8 billion, while maintaining their position as a minority investor.

## Collaboration on AWS Trainium hardware and software

Anthropic is working closely with Annapurna Labs at AWS on the development and optimization of future generations of Trainium accelerators, advancing the capabilities of specialized machine learning hardware. Through deep technical collaboration, we’re writing low-level kernels that allow us to directly interface with the Trainium silicon, and contributing to the AWS Neuron software stack to strengthen Trainium. Our engineers work closely with Annapurna’s chip design team to extract maximum computational efficiency from the hardware, which we plan to leverage to train our most advanced foundation models.

This close hardware-software development approach, combined with the strong price-performance and massive scalability of Trainium platforms, enables us to optimize every aspect of model training from the silicon up through the full stack.

## Claude as core infrastructure

Through Amazon Bedrock, Claude has become core infrastructure for tens of thousands of companies seeking reliable, practical AI solutions at scale. **Pfizer** uses the latest Claude models in Amazon Bedrock to accelerate research and delivery timelines for critical medicines, while saving tens of millions in operational costs. **Intuit** uses Claude in Amazon Bedrock to explain complex tax calculations for millions of users during tax season. **Perplexity**, an AI-powered search engine, delivers more accurate responses at twice the speed by using Claude in Amazon Bedrock, and the **European Parliament** leverages Claude to power ‘Archibot’, making 2.1 million official documents instantly searchable and easier to analyze in multiple languages while reducing research time by 80%.

## Enabling secure, customizable AI solutions

Claude in Amazon Bedrock provides access to frontier intelligence within AWS, allowing customers to keep models and data in the same cloud environment. Building on this unified architecture, organizations can fine-tune Claude models in Amazon Bedrock, [including Claude 3 Haiku](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fine-tune-claude-3-haiku), to tailor outputs to their specific requirements and boost accuracy for domain-specific tasks. Customer proprietary training data remains secure within AWS, preserving our commitment to safety and privacy.

By leveraging AWS’s robust security features and compliance certifications, organizations can confidently deploy AI solutions that meet stringent regulatory requirements. Government customers and industry partners can access Claude’s capabilities through Amazon Bedrock in AWS GovCloud (US). Additionally, government customers can access Claude through Amazon SageMaker in highly controlled environments like the AWS Secret and Top Secret Cloud Regions.

## Powering next-generation AI research and development

Together with AWS, we’re laying the technological foundation—from silicon to software—that will power the next generation of AI research and development. By combining Anthropic’s expertise in frontier AI systems with AWS’s world-class infrastructure, we’re building a secure, enterprise-ready platform that gives organizations of all sizes access to the forefront of AI technology.
