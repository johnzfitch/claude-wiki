Claude Sonnet 4.5 is our most intelligent model for real-world work—and now it's available to everyone on Claude.ai. Whether you're creating documents, analyzing data, or tackling complex research, Sonnet 4.5 delivers professional results faster and with higher quality than ever before.
​

New and improved capabilities

There’s a few areas where Sonnet 4.5 excels compared to Sonnet 4. These include: 

Creating professional quality documents, spreadsheets, and presentations — With enhanced code execution, Sonnet 4.5 is able to build polished deliverables that are actually ready to use. It excels at building complex spreadsheets with working formulas, designing presentations with proper layouts, and generating professional documents.

Writing professional code — Sonnet 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on industry coding benchmarks, writing cleaner code with better planning and fewer mistakes. It thinks through problems more carefully, follows your instructions more precisely, and produces code that actually works—often on the first try.

Thinking longer, and more strategically — Need to analyze a complex dataset, build a multi-feature application, or conduct deep research? Sonnet 4.5 can work independently for hours while maintaining perfect clarity about what you asked for. It tracks its progress methodically, makes steady advances, and provides grounded updates about what it's actually accomplished.

More output in less time — Thanks to its ability to run multiple processes simultaneously, Sonnet 4.5 can output more in less time. That means more docs, more research, and more time saved.

What this means for you 

The impact of a new model is broad, but here’s a few specific ways you can take advantage of Sonnet 4.5, starting today.

Build powerpoints from scratch — Sonnet 4.5 can create polished presentations complete with layouts, and structured content—no template required. Just describe your topic and audience, or upload a doc with notes, and Claude will handle everything else.

Build interactive personal tools — Need a custom web app tailored to your specific needs? Sonnet 4.5 can build interactive tools like this "Life Compass" for personal reflection — a functional application you can actually use.

Create competitive market analysis reports — Sonnet 4.5 can research dozens of competitors simultaneously, compare feature sets and pricing models, analyze market positioning, and synthesize everything into a comprehensive report with verified sources. It maintains strategic focus throughout research sessions, tracking emerging patterns and delivering actionable insights with proper attribution.

 

Prompting tips

Generally speaking, Sonnet 4.5 will react to prompts in similar ways to past Sonnet models, but there’s a few strategies you can use to take advantage of its new skills: 

Give a clear roadmap for sustained tasks — before launching into a big research report or multi-step project, ask Claude to create a detailed plan and checklist in the first conversation, including defining what success looks like at each point in the process. Claude will use this to guide its work, and with improved ability for long-running tasks, it will actually check its work and stick to the plan.

Ask Claude to use tools — Claude can now create powerpoints, docs, and more. If this is your goal, ask! 

Request source verification — When embarking on research tasks that need a paper trail, request source verification to better understand Claude’s response.

Other things you need to know

As you work with Sonnet 4.5 you may notice a few other differences from past models. These “personality quirks” are steerable based on your prompting and personal preferences.

Sonnet 4.5 is more direct — it gets straight to the point with less unnecessary commentary, and gives you factual progress updates rather than overly enthusiastic status reports. If you prefer a different tone (more detailed explanations, more enthusiasm, or step-by-step narration of its work), just tell Claude how you'd like it to communicate, or add it to your personal preferences in settings. 

Sonnet 4.5 asks more questions — this version of Claude is more likely to ask clarifying questions when it's unsure about your task. You can chat with it to refine your ask, or simply tell it to attempt the task if you don’t want to engage. 

Sonnet 4.5 can do more, faster — when researching a topic or gathering information, Claude can search for several things simultaneously rather than one at a time. If Claude's speed feels overwhelming or you prefer a more step-by-step approach, simply tell it "work on one thing at a time" in your instructions.
