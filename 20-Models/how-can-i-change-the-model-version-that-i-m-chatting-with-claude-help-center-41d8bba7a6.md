# How can I change the model version that I’m chatting with?

Updated this week

Use the model selector to switch between available models:

1.  Start chatting with Claude or open an existing chat.

2.  The selected model will appear next to the send button.

3.  To change it, click on the model name and choose which Claude model you’d like to chat with instead.

4.  Click "More models" to view additional options.

5.  If you’ve previously messaged Claude in an existing chat, switching Claude’s model will open a new chat.
