Models & pricing

# Models overview

Copy page

Claude is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. This guide introduces our models and compares their performance.

## 

Choosing a model

If you're unsure which model to use, we recommend starting with **Claude Opus 4.6** for the most complex tasks. It is our latest generation model with exceptional performance in coding and reasoning.

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available via the Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

Once you've picked a model, [learn how to make your first API call](/docs/en/get-started).

Latest models comparison

[TABLE]

*^(1 - See our [pricing page](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for complete pricing information including batch API discounts, prompt caching rates, extended thinking costs, and vision processing fees.)*

*^(2 - **Reliable knowledge cutoff** indicates the date through which a model's knowledge is most extensive and reliable. **Training data cutoff** is the broader date range of training data used. For more information, see [Anthropic's Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency).)*

*^(3 - Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 support a [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) when using the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header. [Long context pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing) applies to requests exceeding 200K tokens.)*

Models with the same snapshot date (e.g., 20240620) are identical across all platforms and do not change. The snapshot date in the model name ensures consistency and allows developers to rely on stable performance across different environments.

Starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5 and all subsequent models**, AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI offer two endpoint types: **global endpoints** (dynamic routing for maximum availability) and **regional endpoints** (guaranteed data routing through specific geographic regions). For more information, see the [third-party platform pricing section](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#third-party-platform-pricing).

### Legacy models

Prompt and output performance

Claude 4 models excel in:

- **Performance**: Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See the [Claude 4 blog post](http://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4) for more information.

- **Engaging responses**: Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.

  - If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to our [prompt engineering guides](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering) for details.
  - For prompting best practices, see our [prompting best practices guide](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices).

- **Output quality**: When migrating from previous model generations to Claude 4, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.

## 

Migrating to Claude 4.6

If you're currently using older Claude models, we recommend migrating to Claude Opus 4.6 to take advantage of improved intelligence and enhanced capabilities. For detailed migration instructions, see [Migrating to Claude 4.6](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide).
