If you receive the following message, "The email you used is either associated with an existing account or an account that was active within the last 30 days," this is due to having a deleted account with multiple attempts to create new accounts with the same email address.

 

If your previous account was disabled for Usage Policy violations, you won't be able to create new accounts with the email address associated with the disabled account, regardless of waiting period.
