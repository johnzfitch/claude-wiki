Users in the EU can open a support inquiry from this page via the chat tool, which serves as our single point of contact for EU users under the DSA.

Follow these [instructions](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) to get support.

## **European Union Monthly Active Recipients**

In accordance with our obligations under Article 24(2) of the DSA, Anthropic publishes information on the average ‘monthly active recipients’ of our online services in the European Union, calculated over a six-month period.\
​\
Anthropic has calculated its average monthly active recipients in the EU for the six-month period ending 31 October 2025, and has concluded that it falls well below the 45 million threshold set out in Article 33(1) of the DSA.\
​\
Anthropic will continue to monitor the number of average monthly active recipients of its services in the EU and will publish updated information at least every 6 months.
