## Considerations for paid Claude accounts

Before deleting Claude accounts with paid subscriptions (Pro or Max plans):

1.  Cancel your subscription from your [Billing settings](https://claude.ai/settings/billing).

2.  Wait until the end of your current subscription period.

3.  Once the subscription lapses, proceed with account deletion.

Click "Delete Account" and follow the prompts. **Please note that deleting your account is permanent** and you will no longer have access to saved chats. If you wish to keep your data, we recommend exporting it before deletion by following the steps listed here: [How can I export my Claude data?](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9450526-how-can-i-export-my-claude-data)

If you have multiple accounts associated with the same email address, you'll need to specify which accounts you want to delete when making your request.

There are some scenarios where you will need to [contact our team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) to delete your account. If this is the case, it will be noted in your account:
