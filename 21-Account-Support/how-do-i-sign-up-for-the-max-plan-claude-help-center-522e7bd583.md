Your Pro plan will be upgraded to Max immediately, with billing adjusted on a prorated basis for the remainder of your current billing cycle.

**Note:** When moving from an annual Pro plan to a Max plan, if the remaining balance on your annual Pro plan is greater than your Max plan price, you will receive a credit to your account for the remaining balance. This credit will be applied to future subscription costs.

## How does subscription renewal work for Max plans?

After subscribing for a Max plan, your subscription will be set to automatically renew at the end of each billing period by default. This ensures uninterrupted access to Max features. However, you have the flexibility to [cancel your paid plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8325617-how-do-i-cancel-my-paid-claude-subscription) at any time if you choose not to continue.
