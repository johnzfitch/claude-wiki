This article applies to individual consumers signing up for paid Pro plans. If you're part of an organization looking to use Claude with your team, refer to [Team and Enterprise Plans](https://support.claude.com/en/collections/9387370-team-and-enterprise-plans).

## Instructions for new users

1.  Navigate to Claude ([claude.ai](http://claude.ai)) in a web browser.

2.  Enter your email address and click “Continue with email” or click “Continue with Google” if applicable.

3.  Follow the Google prompts, or use the emailed login link to access your new Claude account.

4.  Click on your initials or name in the lower left corner and select “Settings” from the menu.

5.  Navigate to [Settings \> Billing](http://claude.ai/settings/billing) and click the “Upgrade plan” button.

6.  After landing on [the upgrade page](https://claude.ai/upgrade), click “Get Pro plan.”

7.  Choose between monthly and annual billing periods.

8.  Enter your payment information and click “Subscribe.”

## Instructions for existing free users

2.  Click on your initials or name in the lower left corner and select “Settings” from the menu.

3.  Navigate to [Settings \> Billing](http://claude.ai/settings/billing) and click the “Upgrade plan” button.

4.  After landing on [the upgrade page](https://claude.ai/upgrade), click “Get Pro plan.”

## How does subscription renewal work for Pro plans?

After subscribing for a Pro plan, your subscription will be set to automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or annual) by default. This ensures uninterrupted access to Pro features. However, you have the flexibility to [cancel your paid plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8325617-how-do-i-cancel-my-paid-claude-subscription) at any time if you choose not to continue.

## I am outside of your supported locations; can I subscribe to the Pro plan?

No. Paid plans are only available for users physically located in one of our [supported locations](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8461763-where-can-i-access-claude), and we require a phone number from a supported location to create an account.

## Is there still a free version of Claude?

Yes. You can still access the free version of Claude without subscribing for a paid plan. Note that like Pro, the free version of Claude is only available to customers physically located in one of our [supported regions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8461763-where-can-i-access-claude).
