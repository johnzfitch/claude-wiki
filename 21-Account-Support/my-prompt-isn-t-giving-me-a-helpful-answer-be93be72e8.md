Claude works best when you give it clear and specific instructions. When crafting your prompt, keep the following principles in mind:

Explain your ask simply and clearly.

Make sure that your prompt contains as much context as possible. Pretend you are giving these instructions to someone with no background knowledge about what you are asking.

Break down complex requests into substeps.

Give Claude feedback: you provide Claude with follow-up instructions, clarifications, or ask it to rewrite an answer.
