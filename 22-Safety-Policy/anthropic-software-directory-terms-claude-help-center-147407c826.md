Anthropic Software Directory Terms

# Anthropic Software Directory Terms

Updated this week

By submitting your MCP server, Skill folder, plugin, app, or other software, container, or data (“Software”) for inclusion in any Anthropic directory, repository, surface, or similar offering (collectively, “Directories”), you represent and warrant to Anthropic that (i) you have and will maintain all necessary rights to provide your Software to users and to grant the rights set forth in these terms; (ii) your Software and the ordinary, intended use of your Software complies with all applicable laws and regulations and does not violate Anthropic’s Software Directory Policy (currently available at <https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13145358-anthropic-software-directory-policy>, as may be updated from time to time); (iii) any information you give us will be accurate and up-to-date; and (iv) if you or your Software collects or shares user information or other personal data, you will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your Software, provide all applicable third-party privacy policies, and ensure all such policies clearly and accurately describe to users what user information you and third parties collect and how you and third parties use and share such information.

You further (i) agree to indemnify and hold Anthropic harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from or related to your Software or users' interactions with it; (ii) grant Anthropic a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to display your name, trademarks, logos, and other branding materials associated with your Software in Directories for the purpose of identifying and promoting your Software, our Directories, and the Anthropic Services to our users and the public; and (iii) authorize Anthropic to review and test your Software in accordance with these terms, to collect and use functional metadata about your Software to improve the Anthropic Services, and to share such functional metadata with our users.

Anthropic has no obligation to include your Software in any Directory and may remove or refuse to display any Software or its content from some or all Directories at any time for any reason (including but not limited to violations of these terms, user complaints, security concerns, or changes to Anthropic's Software Directory Policy) without liability to you. While Anthropic is not obligated to monitor your Software or its content, Anthropic may at any time review or test your Software for security vulnerabilities and to ensure quality and compliance with these terms, our Usage Policy, and our Software Directory Policy.

If Anthropic elects to include your Software in one or more Directories, you agree to continue implementing and maintaining quality and security standards for your Software that are consistent with Anthropic's Software Directory Policy, as may be updated from time to time), and you acknowledge that failure to maintain these standards may result in your Software’s removal from some or all Directories. You further agree to implement and maintain a mechanism for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from Anthropic and from third parties and to investigate such reports with a reasonable standard of care.

You understand that inclusion of your Software in one or more Directories does not create any partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and Anthropic, nor does it grant you any rights to use Anthropic's name, trademarks, or intellectual property. You will not make any statement regarding the Anthropic Services which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Anthropic without Anthropic’s prior written approval, and you will at all times comply with Anthropic’s [Trademark Guidelines](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/trademark-guidelines). Anthropic reserves the right to modify these terms at any time without prior notice, and your continued submission or maintenance of Software in one or more Directories after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.
