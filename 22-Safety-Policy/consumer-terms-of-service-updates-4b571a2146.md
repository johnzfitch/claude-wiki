This support article covers the changes to our Consumer Terms of Service that take effect May 1, 2024. At Anthropic, we review our policies and terms to ensure we’re providing the highest level of protection and clarity for our users.

 

We encourage you to read our updated Consumer Terms of Service in full, but at a high level, our latest updates provide clarity about how you can pay for and manage your subscription to our consumer services (like Claude Pro), if you purchased your subscription via an app.

 

In case you haven't heard, Claude is now available as an iOS app via the Apple App Store, putting the power of AI right in your pocket! And for businesses looking to supercharge their productivity, the new Team plan helps you collaborate with Claude like never before.
