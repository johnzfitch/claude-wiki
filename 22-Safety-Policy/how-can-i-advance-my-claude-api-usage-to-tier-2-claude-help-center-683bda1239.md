How can I advance my Claude API usage to Tier 2?

# How can I advance my Claude API usage to Tier 2?

Updated yesterday

To qualify for usage Tier 2, you'll need to purchase a cumulative total of \$40 of API usage credits on your Claude Console account. Here's what you need to do:

1.  Log into your [Console account](https://platform.claude.com/).

2.  Go to [your Console Billing page](https://platform.claude.com/settings/billing).

3.  Click on the "Buy credits" button.

4.  Add \$40 in usage credits to your balance, either through a single purchase or multiple purchases totaling \$40.

After making this purchase, your account will automatically upgrade to usage Tier 2, increasing your monthly usage limit to \$500. You're not allowed to deposit more than your monthly spend limit, which helps minimize the risk of overfunding your account.

[Refer to our Claude Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/rate-limits) to read more about rate limits and usage tiers.
