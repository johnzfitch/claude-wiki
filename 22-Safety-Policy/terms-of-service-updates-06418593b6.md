At Anthropic, we review our policies and terms to ensure we’re providing the highest level of protection and clarity for our users. This support article covers the changes to our Consumer Terms of Service that take effect April 15, 2024.

 

We encourage you to read our updated Terms of Service in full, but here is a summary of key changes:

Enhanced clarity. With some help from Claude, we reorganized and simplified our Terms of Service to make them easier to understand. 

“Provider” definition. We updated the definition of “Providers” to include our affiliates, licensors, distributors, and service providers. We also clarified that our Providers are intended third-party beneficiaries of specified disclaimers and limitations of liability.

Software updates. We clarified our terms about software updates, including that we may offer automatic updates to our software to ensure our users have access to the latest version.

Open Source. We have also clarified that our software may include open source software and describe how open source license terms interact with our Consumer Terms of Service.
