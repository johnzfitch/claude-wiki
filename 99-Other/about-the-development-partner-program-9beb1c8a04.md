The Development Partner Program is an optional, transparent way for organizations to help shape the future of Claude while maintaining control over their data.

 

By default, Anthropic doesn’t train our models on the data you generate when using our commercial products (e.g. Claude for Work, Claude API, etc.). Learn more about our commitments to privacy and how we handle your data in our Privacy Center.

 

We recognize that many organizations want to contribute to the advancement of AI technology. The Development Partner Program allows you to voluntarily choose whether you allow us to use your Claude Code sessions to improve our services, including model training. This voluntary sharing helps us enhance Claude's coding capabilities across all users, improve our models based on actual developer workflows, and advance the field of AI-assisted coding.

 

What is the Development Partner Program?

Through the Development Partner Program, eligible organizations can contribute to improving Claude by voluntarily sharing their Claude Code sessions with us.

 

Key Information

Under the Development Partner Program, only your Claude Code input and output tokens from the first-party Claude API are provided to us. Data sharing does not apply to Claude apps or API calls unrelated to Claude Code, when using our commercial products.

Your data will be stored securely for up to two years, and data used for model training will not be associated with other customer information.

This setting applies to all members in your organization.

All members in your organization will be informed that you have enrolled into the program.

You can leave the program at any time, but previously provided data will be stored for up to 2 years.

Accounts on our zero data retention agreement are not eligible for the program.
