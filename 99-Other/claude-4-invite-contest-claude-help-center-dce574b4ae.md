The Claude 4 Invite Contest is a chance to win four months of Max plan for Claude by inviting friends and family to try Claude 4, our newest and most powerful AI model.

## What are the rewards?

Selected participants who successfully refer new users are entered into a drawing to win:

- **Four months of Max plan** for Claude apps (valued at \$400)

  - Max 5x users: You will receive four months of Max plan, completely free.

- For iOS users: You'll need to cancel your App Store subscription first so we can apply the free month credits.
