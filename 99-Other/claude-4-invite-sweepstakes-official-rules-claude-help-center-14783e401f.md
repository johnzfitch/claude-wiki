Claude 4 Invite Sweepstakes Official Rules

# Claude 4 Invite Sweepstakes Official Rules

Updated this week

By entering the Claude 4 Invite Sweepstakes, you accept and agree to these Official Rules and the decisions of Anthropic, PBC (“Anthropic”) which shall be final in all matters.

1.  **NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.**

2.  **HOW TO ENTER.** Beginning on May 22nd, 2025 at 9am ET through June 4th, 2025 at 9am ET, log into your Claude.ai account and navigate to [https://claude.ai/invite](https://claude.ai/invite) to find your unique referral link. For each unique person who signs up for a first-time Claude.ai account using your unique referral link and sends at least one message to Claude, you will be entered into the sweepstakes pool. No more than 100 entries per user. Use of any robotic, automatic, programmed, or similar entry method or entering more than the number of times permitted will void all entries and result in disqualification. You may not enter more times than indicated by using multiple email addresses, identities, or devices in an attempt to circumvent the rules.

3.  **ELIGIBILITY.** To participate, you must (i) have a registered Claude.ai account, (ii) reside in the United States (excluding Florida, New York, and Rhode Island), Argentina, Austria, Barbados, Bermuda, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, and (iii) be at least 18 years of age. Employees of Anthropic, PBC and its affiliates and their immediate family members are not eligible. Void where prohibited.

4.  **DRAWING.** Anthropic will conduct a random drawing from among all eligible entries received to select 5 winners every day for 10 days starting on or about May 27th, 2025. Potential winners will be notified by email and must respond with the requested information within 72 hours of the date notice is sent. Failure to respond within the applicable time period will result in forfeiture of prize and Anthropic shall have the option to award the prize to an alternate winner. The return of any prize notification or prize as undeliverable may result in disqualification and an alternate winner may be selected.

5.  **PRIZES.** Four month subscription to Claude Max 5x Plan (approximate value: \$400). Total prize value: approximately \$40,000. Current subscribers will receive a pro-rata refund for remaining subscription time. Non-paying users will receive the subscription at no cost. Limit one prize per person. No substitution or transfer of prize permitted by winner.

6.  PRIVACY. Anthropic will use your email address and referral link information to administer the contest as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy).

7.  **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.** By entering this sweepstakes, you waive all right to, and hold Anthropic harmless from, any claim, liability, loss, damage (including punitive, incidental, and consequential damages), or expense (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with participation in this sweepstakes or the acceptance, use, or misuse of any prize. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8.  **CHOICE OF LAW.** These Official Rules will be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict of law principles. You and Anthropic agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to these Official Rules will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and Anthropic submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. By accessing our Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions.
