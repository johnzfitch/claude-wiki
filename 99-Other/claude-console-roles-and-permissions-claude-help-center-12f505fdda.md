The Claude Console uses a role-based access system with five distinct roles: User, Claude Code User, Developer, Billing, and Admin. Each role has specific permissions and capabilities designed to help teams manage their API access securely.

## Role Types and Permissions

### User

- Can only use Workbench

- Cannot view API keys, usage logs, or billing details.

### Claude Code User

- Can use Workbench and [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)

- Can access Claude Code workspace in your org

### Developer

- Can use Workbench and [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)

- Can manage API keys

- Can view usage and cost data

### Billing

- Can use Workbench

- Can manage billing details

- Can view usage and cost data

- Cannot access Claude Code workspace in your org

### Admin

- Can perform all actions available to User, Developer, and Billing roles

- Can manage users and their role assignments

## Workspace-Level Permissions

- Organization Admins automatically receive Workspace Admin permissions in all Workspaces.

- Organization Billing role holders can view cost, usage, and limit values across all Workspaces.

- Organization-level roles serve as a baseline, while Workspace roles can grant additional permissions.

  - For example, a User at the organization level can be granted Admin permissions within specific Workspaces

## Important Notes

- Removing an Admin or Billing role does not automatically update the billing email in our payment processor.

- To modify the primary billing email address or add additional billing contact emails, please [contact our Support Team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support).
