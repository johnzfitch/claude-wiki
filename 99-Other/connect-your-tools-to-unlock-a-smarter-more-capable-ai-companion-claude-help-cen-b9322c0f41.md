Without access to your actual work, Claude is only ever as good as generic knowledge and simple text outputs — it’s helpful, but lacks detail, and requires copying and pasting, to get to a shippable final product. What if it could do more? Connectors help solve this context problem. In just a few clicks, you can give Claude access to your knowledge in connected tools and desktop files, **plus** the permission to perform actions in those sources on your behalf.

## MCP-powered capabilities, without the complex setup

Connectors let Claude **understand** and **take action** in your connected tools. In the connectors menu you’ll see both 1st party and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations, which are a secure way for Claude to connect with your tools and data. This transforms it from a helpful assistant into an informed collaborator who actually understands and can help with your work. You can learn more about custom MCP servers [here](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp).

In short, think of Connectors as giving Claude a key to an otherwise locked door. Suddenly, with your direction, Claude can:

- Retrieve your actual project data

- Make connections across disparate bits of information

- Take actions in your tools – like creating Asana tasks

Not only do connectors make Claude more knowledgeable, they make it more useful, too.

## Using the connectors directory

The Connectors directory allows you to connect tools to Claude in just a few clicks. To find it, navigate to the “Search and tools” menu in Claude chat, then hit “Add connectors.”

From here, you can connect Claude to your preferred tools, with more being added all the time. In the directory, you’ll find pre-built connectors in two categories:

- **Web** — these let you to connect and authenticate to remote services, like your Google Drive and Gmail, Asana, Notion, Canva, and more.

- **Desktop extensions (app only)** — these allow Claude to work with desktop apps and files on your computer like your notes, messages, and code files.

## Setting up your first connection

To set up your first connection, pick an app you use often and follow the steps below:

1.  **Select a source and click connect**. The directory safely handles the typical MCP configuration that used to require pretty technical implementation and copying URLs.

2.  *\[Web connectors only\]* **Provide authentication**. You’ll need to sign in to your accounts in other tools to grant Claude access.

3.  **Test it out.** From here, you’re ready to enjoy your new connection. The simplest way to ensure your connection is working is just to ask Claude if it has access to a specific tool. For a more interesting test case, try asking it to summarize content or take actions in connected tools on your behalf – like in the examples below.

## Connectors in action

Connectors don’t just bring context to Claude, they create a dynamic bridge across all of the tools you use to get work done. Here’s how that might show up in your workflows:

- **Ship faster with real context** (Linear + Notion) - Ask Claude to write release notes from your latest sprint, and it pulls actual Linear tickets to generate professional documentation with real feature descriptions. Add in context like your release note template and style guide, and you’ll have a professional draft in minutes:

- **Turn meeting notes into action** (Apple Notes + Asana) - Transform scattered thoughts into organized project plans with one command. Claude can read your Apple Notes on desktop, and create Asana tasks with realistic deadlines — even assigning owners based on your discussion.

- **Create professional content at scale** (Docs + Canva) - Claude can read your blog posts or product docs to quickly build professional visuals based on your written content. Just ask for a Canva design based on a resource you’ve already made:

## Best practices

When used well, Connectors can help Claude see what you see, know what you know, and do the work that actually matters to you. Here’s a few more tips and tricks to improve your results with Connectors:

- **Be specific about which tool to use** — Don't just say "find my document" - instead, try "Using Google Drive, search for the Q3 budget spreadsheet in the Finance folder." The more specific you are, the faster Claude can help you find what you need.

- **Have a conversation, don't try to move mountains** — Break complex tasks into steps rather than asking Claude to do everything at once. First check your calendar, then search related emails, then draft your response. This approach helps prevent errors and gives you better results.

- **Combine tools for powerful workflows** — Claude's real strength emerges when you layer multiple tools together. Pull project updates from Asana, then craft a summarized update to help prioritize your work. Review your calendar and project docs, then analyze your meeting schedule to make sure you’re spending time wisely

- **Layer in context from multiple sources** — When asking Claude to create content, provide relevant background information. Share your brand style guide from Google Drive before asking for marketing copy. Include previous project notes from Asana when planning next steps. The more context you provide, the more tailored Claude's output will be.
