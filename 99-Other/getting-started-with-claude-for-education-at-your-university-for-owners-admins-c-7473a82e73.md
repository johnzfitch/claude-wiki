This guide helps Admins, Owners, and Primary Owners set up and manage Claude for Education at universities. Account users can find more information in our [FAQs for student, faculty, and other users](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11139144-faqs-on-using-claude-for-education-at-your-university).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting started

Before setting up your Claude for Education account, review these essential resources:

- [Important Considerations Before Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) and JIT/SCIM Provisioning](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10276682-important-considerations-before-enabling-single-sign-on-sso-and-jit-scim-provisioning)

- [Setting up Single Sign-On](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13132885-setting-up-single-sign-on-sso)

- [Setting up JIT or SCIM provisioning](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13133195-setting-up-jit-or-scim-provisioning)

Note the following information from [Important Considerations Before Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) and JIT/SCIM Provisioning](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10276682-important-considerations-before-enabling-single-sign-on-sso-and-jit-scim-provisioning):

When enforcing SSO on your Education account, there are two distinct categories to consider for existing users who are using their university email:

1.  Users with existing Free/Pro/Team accounts who ARE added to your SSO application

    - These users will maintain access to their existing Free/Pro/Team accounts

    - They will have the ability to toggle between the Education account and their previous accounts by clicking the profile icon with their initials in the bottom left corner\
      ​

2.  Users with existing Free/Pro/Team accounts who are NOT added to your SSO application

    - If "Enforce SSO for Claude.ai" is NOT enabled: These users can still access their existing accounts using the "Continue with email" option

    - If "Enforce SSO for Claude.ai" IS enabled: These users will be unable to access their existing Free/Pro/Team accounts

      - Please note, these accounts are not deleted, but can no longer be accessed as the user is unable to login via SSO.

## Enabling and Using Education Features

After getting started with your plan, choose which Education features you’d like use and configure them in your account:

## Setting Up Support Paths

Anthropic Support assists Primary Owners and Owners directly. See [How to Get Support](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) for more information on your support options.

Individual users should follow one of two paths to receive support:

1.  Self-serve with our [Help Center](https://support.claude.com/en/).

2.  Escalate questions through university support channels.

We recommend setting up a documented support channel for any user escalations prior to going live at your university.

In addition, share the [FAQs on using Claude for Education at your university](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11139144-faqs-on-using-claude-for-education-at-your-university) to help users get started successfully.
