Organization data exports are only available to Team and Enterprise plan Primary Owners. Data exports include conversation data and the user data for your account.

Primary Owners of Team and Enterprise plans can export organization data from Admin settings > Data and Privacy on the web app or Claude Desktop.

 

Follow these steps to export your organization's data:

Click on your initials in the lower left corner of your account.

Select "Admin settings" from the menu.

Click "Data and privacy" to open that section.

Click on the "Export Data" button.

Once the export has been processed, you will receive a download link via email.

Important: Messages, files, and projects deleted from your account, either manually by individual users or via enterprise retention settings, will not be included in data exports initiated after the deletion.

Please note:

There may be a small delay while the export is generated.

The email will be sent to the address associated with your account.

You must be signed in to your account to download your data using this link.

The download link will expire 24 hours after delivery.

If your link expires, you can always request a new one by repeating the export process.

If you're an Enterprise Primary Owner looking to export audit logs, see How to Access Audit Logs.
