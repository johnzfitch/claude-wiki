Updated this week

Your Claude API organization's rate limit depends on your usage tier, which will increase automatically from Tier 1 to Tier 4 as you reach certain thresholds while using the API. Your usage tier also determines your monthly spend limit, which increases as you progress through the tiers. You can see your organization’s tier at [Settings \> Limits](https://platform.claude.com/settings/limits).

Refer to the [Rate limits page in our Claude docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/rate-limits) for more information.

If you're interested in custom rate limits, please [contact our Sales team](https://claude.com/contact-sales).
