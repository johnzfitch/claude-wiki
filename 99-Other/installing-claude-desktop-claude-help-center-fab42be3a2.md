## Desktop Extensions

Desktop extensions transform how you connect Claude to your desktop applications and data. Similar to browser extensions, these secure, installable packages let you:

- **Connect Claude to your desktop apps with one click**: Install extensions that integrate with your local files, calendars, emails, and messaging apps.

- **Access a curated directory of extensions**: Browse verified extensions directly within Claude Desktop, including options like iMessage and filesystem access.

- **Enjoy enterprise-ready security**: Extensions use code signing, encrypted storage for sensitive data like API keys, and enterprise policy controls.

To explore desktop extensions, navigate to Settings \> Extensions within the Claude Desktop app after installation.

**Note:** We’re building a directory of desktop extensions – if you’re a developer hoping to add an extension you built to the directory, complete our [desktop extensions interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14_Dmcig4z8NeRMB_e7TOyrKzuZ88-BLYdLvS6LPhiZU/viewform?edit_requested=true) to share more information with us.

## Cowork

Cowork is available as a research preview for all paid plans (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise) using the Claude Desktop app on macOS.

Users on paid Claude plans can access Cowork in Claude Desktop. This research preview brings Claude Code's agentic capabilities to a visual interface, allowing you to hand off complex, multi-step tasks without using a terminal.

With Cowork, Claude can:

- Access your local files directly without manual uploads.

- Work on long-running tasks like research synthesis, file organization, and document generation.

- Coordinate parallel workstreams for complex projects.

- Deliver professional outputs like spreadsheets with working formulas and formatted presentations.

Cowork runs in an isolated virtual machine on your computer for security, with controlled file and network access.
