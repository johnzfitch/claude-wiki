Claude lets you view and manage all the devices and browsers where you're currently logged in. This helps you stay in control of your account security — if you notice a session you don't recognize, or you want to log out of a device you no longer use, you can terminate that session directly.

 

What you'll see

Each active session displays the following information:

Device and browser — The browser and operating system used for the session (e.g., "Chrome on macOS")

Location — The approximate geographic location based on IP address

Updated — When this session was last used or modified by a policy change

Current session — A badge indicating which session you're using right now

 

View your active sessions

Click your profile icon in the bottom-left corner.

Navigate to Settings > Account.

Scroll to the Active sessions section.

 

Terminate a session

If you see a session you don't recognize or no longer need, you can terminate it remotely. This will log that device out of your Claude account.

Find the session you want to terminate.

Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to that session.

Select "Terminate."

Confirm your choice in the modal that appears.

Note: Once a session is terminated, that device will need to log in again to access your account.

 

Log out of your current session

You can also log out of the device you're currently using from this page:

Find the session marked as Current.

Click the three-dot menu (⋮).

Select "Log out."

Confirm your choice.

This works the same as logging out from the main menu.

 

Why this matters

Previously, there was no way to see what sessions were active on your account. With session management, you can:

See all devices and locations where your account is logged in

Spot unfamiliar sessions that might indicate unauthorized access

Immediately revoke access by terminating suspicious sessions

If you ever notice a session from a location you don't recognize or a device you don't use, terminate it right away and consider changing your password.
