My prompt isn’t giving me a helpful answer.

# My prompt isn’t giving me a helpful answer.

Updated this week

Claude works best when you give it clear and specific instructions. When crafting your prompt, keep the following principles in mind:

- Explain your ask simply and clearly.

- Make sure that your prompt contains as much context as possible. Pretend you are giving these instructions to someone with no background knowledge about what you are asking.

- Break down complex requests into substeps.

- Give Claude feedback: you provide Claude with follow-up instructions, clarifications, or ask it to rewrite an answer.
