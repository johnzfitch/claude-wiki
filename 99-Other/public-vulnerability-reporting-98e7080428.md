Help us improve AI safety by reporting universal jailbreaks

This form allows you to submit universal jailbreaks for ASL-3 uses of concern (meaning elicit information related to biological threats) that you've identified. Universal jailbreaks are techniques that allow users to consistently bypass safety measures across multiple harmful queries.
