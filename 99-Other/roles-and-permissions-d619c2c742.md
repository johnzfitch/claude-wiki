What an individual can see and do in their Team or Enterprise plan account is dictated by their role. Roles are provisioned with the following permissions.

Important notes about the Primary Owner role: 

Team and Enterprise organizations can only have one Primary Owner.

The Primary Owner seat uses one of your plan's licenses.

Your organization's Primary Owner can be a service account that isn't tied to an individual user.
