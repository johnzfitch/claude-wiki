How Claude Uses Aiera Data

Claude applies Aiera’s intelligence platform to support real-time market analysis and due diligence workflows.

Post-Earnings Analysis: Immediately following earnings releases, retrieve full call transcripts to analyze management commentary, extract key metrics discussed, and identify forward-looking statements. Compare current quarter commentary to prior periods.

Analyst Question Analysis: Extract and categorize questions from sell-side analysts during Q&A sessions to understand market concerns, identify emerging themes, and gauge sentiment on specific business drivers.

Management Tone Assessment: Analyze management language across multiple quarters to detect shifts in confidence levels, strategic priorities, or responses to competitive pressures.

Cross-Company Theme Detection: Search transcripts across multiple companies for mentions of specific topics like supply chain, pricing power, or regulatory changes to build sector-wide perspectives on emerging trends.

Filing Monitoring: Track 8-K filings for material events like management changes, acquisitions, or contract wins. Monitor 10-Q/10-K filings for MD&A sections discussing business outlook and risk factors.

Event-Driven Research: When news breaks or markets move, quickly pull relevant corporate communications to understand company positioning and official statements on developing situations.

Common Use Cases
Post-Earnings Deep Dive

Example input prompt:

Pull the transcript from Netflix’s most recent earnings call and 
summarize: (1) revenue and subscriber growth discussed, (2) key themes 
from management presentation, (3) top analyst questions and concerns, and 
(4) any forward guidance provided.

When to use: Immediately after earnings releases to quickly digest management commentary and market reaction before research reports publish.

 

Typical timeframe: Most valuable within 24-48 hours of earnings when transcripts are fresh and before consensus views form.

 

Analyst Question Tracking

Example input prompt:

What were the main questions analysts asked on the last three Microsoft 
earnings calls? Identify recurring themes and any new topics of concern 
that emerged in recent quarters.

When to use: Understanding evolving market concerns and identifying which business segments or metrics are drawing increased scrutiny.

 

Tip: Track 2-4 quarters to identify developing themes versus one-time questions.

 

Management Commentary Search

Example input prompt:

Search the last four Amazon earnings calls for what management said about 
capital expenditure plans and AWS infrastructure investments. Has their 
tone or guidance changed?

When to use: Tracking specific strategic initiatives or business drivers across time to detect shifts in company priorities or investment thesis.

 

Works well with: 3-6 quarters of transcripts to establish patterns and identify inflection points.

 

Cross-Company Theme Analysis

Example input prompt:

mentions of “artificial intelligence” or “AI.” Which sectors are 
discussing it most and what are they saying about implementation?

When to use: Identifying emerging trends across markets and understanding which industries are most affected by macro themes.

 

Note: Combine with sector filters to focus analysis on relevant industry groups.

 

Upcoming Events Planning

Example input prompt:

Show me all confirmed earnings calls for companies in the technology 
sector over the next two weeks. I want to prepare analysis ahead of these 
events.

When to use: Planning research calendar and ensuring coverage of important corporate events for portfolio holdings or coverage universe.

 

Key benefit: Get ahead of events rather than reacting after the fact.

Find all 8-K filings from companies in my watchlist over the past month. 
Focus on those related to management changes, acquisitions, or material 
contracts.

When to use: Monitoring portfolio holdings for material corporate developments between regular reporting periods.

capacity utilization?

When to use: Supplementing quantitative company data with qualitative expert perspectives on industry dynamics.

 

Works well with: Combining expert insights with company earnings commentary for comprehensive sector views.
