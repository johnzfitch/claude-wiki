Claude Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, and Opus 4.1 models are available in public preview in Microsoft Foundry, where Azure customers can build production applications and enterprise agents.

 

This integration enables developers to:

Start building immediately: Deploy Claude through Foundry's APIs, tools, and workflows.

Use your existing Azure agreements: Claude is eligible for Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC), and works with current Azure agreements and billing, eliminating separate vendor approvals.

Build in your preferred language: Access Claude using Python, TypeScript, and C# SDKs with Microsoft Entra authentication.

If you need support while using Claude through Microsoft Foundry, review the Azure AI services support and help options. For specific details, including support channels, SLAs, escalation protocols, etc., please consult your Foundry agreement.

 

Refer to our Claude Docs for more information.
