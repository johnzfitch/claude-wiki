[​](#get-started-with-claude-for-powerpoint)

Get started with Claude for PowerPoint


[​](#supported-versions)

Supported versions

Claude for PowerPoint runs on the following PowerPoint builds.

- PowerPoint on the web
- PowerPoint on Windows with a Microsoft 365 subscription, build 16.0.13127.20296 or later
- PowerPoint on Mac, version 16.46 or later


[​](#install-for-yourself)

Install for yourself

1

Open the marketplace listing

Go to the [Claude for Microsoft 365 listing on Microsoft AppSource](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200010725?tab=Overview).

2

Install the add-in

Select “Get it now” to install.

3

Sign in

Open PowerPoint, activate the add-in, and sign in with your Claude account.


[​](#deploy-to-your-organization)

Deploy to your organization

Organization admins can deploy Claude for PowerPoint through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

1

Allow Office Store access

In the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to Settings, Org Settings, User owned apps and services, and turn on [“Let users access the Office Store”](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center).

2

Open Integrated apps

Go to Settings, Integrated apps, Add-ins.

3

Find the add-in

Search for “Claude for Microsoft 365” in Microsoft AppSource.

4

Deploy

Assign the add-in to your organization or to specific users or groups. Share [Microsoft’s deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins) with your team for activation steps.

If your organization uses Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for admin roles, the Integrated apps page does not recognize roles activated through PIM, so deployment fails. This is a [known Microsoft issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/resources/resources-office-add-in-known-issues), tracking ID 11126536. To work around it, deploy from an admin account with the required role assigned as permanently active rather than PIM-eligible. See [Microsoft’s troubleshooting guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoft-365/admin/miscellaneous/cannot-deploy-add-in-integrated-apps-menu). Individual users can still [install the add-in themselves](#install-for-yourself).

After deployment, users can activate the Claude add-in from Tools, Add-ins on Mac or Home, Add-ins on Windows, sign in, and start working.

Organizations that have disabled “Let users access the Office Store” may find that admin-deployed add-ins don’t appear for users. To work around this, deploy using the manifest XML file described below.


[​](#deploy-with-a-custom-manifest)

Deploy with a custom manifest

For IT administrators deploying to multiple users when the Office Store is disabled:

1

Download the manifest

Download the [custom manifest XML file](https://pivot.claude.ai/manifest-powerpoint.xml) and save it to a secure location.

2

Open the Admin Center

Go to [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com), sign in, and open Settings, Integrated apps.

3

Upload the custom add-in

Select “Upload custom apps”, choose “Office Add-in”, then “I have a manifest file on this device”. Upload the manifest.

4

Assign users

Choose entire organization, specific users, specific groups, or just yourself for admin testing.

5

Deploy

Review settings and select “Deploy”. The add-in is available within minutes. Full organization rollout can take up to 24 hours.

After deployment, users see Claude in PowerPoint’s Home ribbon and sign in with their Claude credentials on first use.


[​](#connect-through-a-third-party-platform)

Connect through a third-party platform

If your organization routes AI traffic through Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Azure AI Foundry, or an LLM gateway, your admin can deploy the add-in without individual Claude accounts. See [Use Claude for M365 with third-party platforms](/docs/office-agents/third-party-platforms).


[​](#key-features)

Key features


[​](#build-from-templates)

Build from templates

Start with a client or corporate template already loaded. Describe what you need, and Claude generates slides using the correct layouts, fonts, and colors from the slide master. Claude reads your deck’s template and respects its formatting rules. Example prompts:

- “Create a market sizing section, 3 slides covering TAM, SAM, SOM with supporting visuals.”
- “Add an executive summary slide using the one-column content layout.”


[​](#edit-existing-slides)

Edit existing slides

Select a slide and tell Claude what to change. Claude makes edits while preserving formatting and surrounding context. Example prompts:

- “Simplify the text on this slide.”
- “Add a chart showing the quarterly trend.”
- “Restructure the storyline across slides 4 to 7.”


[​](#generate-full-decks)

Generate full decks

Open a blank deck and describe your goal. Claude builds a draft with logical structure and professional defaults, which you can refine. Example prompts:

- “Create a 10-slide deck walking through our market entry hypotheses.”
- “Build an internal project update presentation with timeline and next steps.”


[​](#create-native-charts-and-diagrams)

Create native charts and diagrams

Convert bullet points into professional visuals such as diagrams, process flows, or editable native PowerPoint charts. Claude produces visuals you can edit directly, not static images. Example prompts:

- “Turn these bullets into a process flow diagram.”
- “Create a bar chart comparing Q1 to Q4 performance.”


[​](#template-awareness)

Template awareness

Claude reads the slide master, layouts, fonts, and color scheme in your deck and uses them when generating or editing slides. It aims to maintain template compliance without introducing off-brand elements.


[​](#connectors-and-skills)

Connectors and Skills

Claude for PowerPoint supports connectors for pulling external context into your deck, and Skills for applying reusable task recipes. See [Connectors and Skills](/docs/office-agents/connectors-and-skills) for details.


[​](#set-persistent-instructions)

Set persistent instructions

Open Settings in the add-in sidebar and use the Instructions field to set preferences that apply to every conversation in PowerPoint. Instructions are useful for brand guidelines such as “always use one-line bullets” or “use the blue accent color for highlights”, preferred slide structure, or recurring context about your workflow. Instructions you set in PowerPoint only apply to PowerPoint. They are separate from Instructions you set in Excel or Word.


[​](#work-across-m365-apps)

Work across M365 apps

Claude for PowerPoint shares context with Claude for Excel, Word, and Outlook, so a single conversation can span your open deck, workbook, document, and inbox. See [Work across M365 apps](/docs/office-agents/work-across-apps).


[​](#context-and-session-management)

Context and session management

The add-in handles long sessions for you so a single conversation can span an entire workflow.

- **Auto-compaction**: longer conversations are automatically compacted into new conversations to avoid running out of context. See [Understanding usage and length limits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11647753-understanding-usage-and-length-limits).

Your use of Claude for PowerPoint is associated with your existing Claude account and is subject to the same usage limits.


[​](#models-available)

Models available

Claude for M365 offers a curated subset of the Claude models: the ones that work best for Office tasks, so the list you see in the add-in can be shorter than what you see in Claude.ai. Your organization’s model access settings also apply, and a model appears here only if your role permits it. See [Manage model access for your organization](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15694740-manage-model-access-for-your-organization) for how those settings interact with each product. If you connect through Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Azure AI Foundry, or an LLM gateway, the available models come from that platform and your admin’s configuration instead of your Claude.ai model access settings. See [Use Claude for M365 with third-party platforms](/docs/office-agents/third-party-platforms) for details.


[​](#data-handling)

Data handling

Inputs and outputs are deleted on the backend within 30 days of receipt or generation, except in cases outlined in [How long do you store my organization’s data?](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data). Data is cached for a number of hours after deletion so users can access context in recently closed presentations. Chat history is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. Conversations are not stored on Anthropic’s servers, are not synced across devices, and can be cleared from Settings at any time. Reinstalling the add-in or switching between Claude add-ins does not remove it. See [Data storage and retention](/docs/office-agents/data-storage) for where it sits on disk and how long it is kept. Claude for PowerPoint does not inherit custom data retention settings your organization might have set. Activity is not included in Enterprise audit logs. For Enterprise organizations with the [Compliance API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api) enabled, Claude for PowerPoint sessions are included in the Compliance API. This coverage is in public beta and requires no additional setup: the same Compliance Access Keys apply.


[​](#current-limitations)

Current limitations

Claude for PowerPoint is not recommended for:

- Final client deliverables without human review.
- Presentations containing highly sensitive or regulated data without proper controls.
- Replacing your judgment on design and narrative flow.


[​](#unsupported-versions)

Unsupported versions

The add-in does not run on these PowerPoint versions.

- PowerPoint 2016 and 2019 perpetual or volume license.
- PowerPoint on iPad.
- PowerPoint on Android.
- Older builds of Microsoft 365 PowerPoint below the SharedRuntime threshold.


[​](#prompt-injection-risk)

Prompt injection risk

Only use Claude for PowerPoint with trusted files. Files from external sources can contain hidden instructions that manipulate the add-in into extracting data, modifying records, or performing destructive actions.

External files such as downloaded templates, vendor files, collaborative documents, and data imports can contain prompt injections that try to trick Claude into taking unintended actions. Testing has identified scenarios where Claude for PowerPoint can be manipulated to extract sensitive information, modify critical data, or perform destructive actions if allowed to act without verification. When Claude proposes a risky operation, you are asked to confirm before it runs. Review confirmations carefully, especially for files from external sources.


[​](#best-practices)

Best practices

Follow these guidelines to use Claude for PowerPoint safely and effectively.

- Always review changes before finalizing your work.
- Start with your template already applied before asking Claude to generate content.
- Be specific about what you want changed. Claude can target individual slides or elements.
- Verify that outputs match your organization’s brand guidelines.
