Claude in Xcode is available for individuals with Pro and Max plans, and users with premium seats on Team and Enterprise plans.

Claude Sonnet 4 is now available in Xcode 26, bringing AI-powered coding assistance directly to Apple's integrated development environment (IDE).

## What you can do with Claude in Xcode

Claude Sonnet 4 powers several coding intelligence features in Xcode:

### Coding assistant

Ask questions about your code in natural language. Claude understands your project's context and remembers your conversation as you work. You can attach files and get help with debugging issues, improving code structure, and developing new features.

### Coding tools

- Generate documentation for your code

- Get explanations of highlighted sections

- Create SwiftUI previews and playgrounds

- Make inline code changes directly in your editor

- Automatically fix warnings and errors

## Getting started with Claude in Xcode

To start using Claude in Xcode:

1.  [Download Xcode 26](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

2.  Open Xcode preferences and navigate to the Intelligence settings.

3.  Log in with your Claude account.

## Usage limits

Your Claude usage limits are shared across all platforms, so your chats with Claude and coding work in Xcode will draw from the same limits with a five-hour reset period, and will count towards your weekly usage limits. You will see the following message upon reaching either of your limits: “You've reached your rate limit, please try again later.”
