### Capabilities[](#capabilities)

The Daloopa integration enables Claude to access comprehensive financial data from public company filings.

- **Company Discovery and Identification:** Search for companies using ticker symbols or company names across Daloopa's database of 3,500+ public companies. The search handles name variations and automatically matches to the correct entity.

- **Financial Metric Discovery:** Explore all available data series for any company, including standard financial statements and company-specific KPIs like subscriber counts for streaming services or wafer shipments for semiconductors. This reveals unique operational metrics beyond standard line items.

- **Historical Data Retrieval:** Access specific financial fundamentals across custom time periods, with most companies having 10+ years of data. Request individual quarters, full years, or any combination for flexible analysis.

- **Source-Linked Data Points:** Every financial value includes a hyperlink to its exact location in SEC filings or investor materials, providing complete transparency and audit trails.

- **Flexible Period Selection:** Request data for any combination of quarters or years to enable quarter-over-quarter comparisons, year-over-year analyses, or custom period selections matching your analytical needs.

- **Granular Metric Access:** Access specific line items like segment revenue breakdowns or working capital components without retrieving entire financial statements.

- **Earnings Analysis Automation:** Following releases, pulls latest results and compares to prior periods, calculating variances and presenting structured analysis of key changes.
