## Common Use Cases[](#common-use-cases)

### Contract Review and Analysis[](#contract-review-and-analysis)

**Use Case:** Legal teams need to review multiple contracts for specific clauses and terms.

For this analysis, Claude might use the following workflow:

1.  **Advanced Search:** Use the advanced_search tool to locate all contracts in a specific folder, filtering by file type (e.g., PDF) and date range to find relevant documents.
2.  **Document Interrogation:** Apply the ask_document tool to query specific clauses or terms within each contract, such as “What are the termination conditions?” or “What is the liability cap?”
3.  **Content Summarization:** Generate summaries of key terms using summarize_document to create concise overviews of each contract’s main provisions.
4.  **Cross-Document Comparison:** Compare multiple contracts by asking questions across documents to identify common terms, variations in clauses, or outlier provisions.

Claude would then provide a comprehensive analysis showing key findings, comparisons across contracts, and any notable clauses requiring attention.

### Due Diligence Research[](#due-diligence-research)

**Use Case:** Investment teams need to analyze company documents during due diligence processes.

Example input prompt:

## Tips for Using Egnyte[](#tips-for-using-egnyte)

- Be specific about file locations and criteria when searching. Including folder paths, date ranges, and file types helps Claude locate the exact documents you need.
  - Example: Instead of “Find the contract”, try “Search for PDF contracts in the Legal/Vendor folder from 2024”
- Use natural language when asking questions about documents. The ask_document and Copilot tools understand conversational queries.
  - Example: “What are the payment terms?” or “Summarize the main risks outlined in this document”
- Leverage Knowledge Bases for frequently accessed information. If your organization has created Knowledge Bases, reference them for faster access to curated content.
  - Example: “Query the HR Knowledge Base for our vacation policy”
- Remember that all access respects your Egnyte permissions. Claude can only access files and folders you have permission to view, ensuring security and proper access control.
- For complex analyses involving multiple documents, consider providing folder paths or specific file IDs to help Claude locate the right content efficiently.
- When working with large document sets, use filters and metadata to narrow results before asking Claude to analyze or summarize content.
