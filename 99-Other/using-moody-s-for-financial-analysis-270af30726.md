## Tips for Using Moody’s[](#tips-for-using-moodys)

- Be specific about entities: When searching for entities, include relevant identifiers like ticker symbols, full legal names, or location information for more accurate results.

  - Example: Instead of “Apple”, try “Apple Inc. (AAPL)”

- Leverage rating drivers for forward-looking analysis: The rating upgrade/downgrade factors provide valuable insights into what could change an entity’s credit profile.

  - Example: “What factors would lead to a downgrade of Company X’s rating?”

- Combine tools for comprehensive analysis: Use multiple tools together to build complete credit profiles. Start with ratings, then examine scorecards and drivers, and supplement with research.

- Access is governed by your Moody’s subscription: Claude can only access data and research that your Moody’s account has permission to view. The connector respects your subscription entitlements.

- Use research search for sector insights: The document search isn’t limited to individual entities. Search by sector, theme, or risk type to find broader market analysis.

  - Example: “Find Moody’s research on renewable energy sector credit trends”

- Rating scorecards provide methodology transparency: Review scorecards to understand how Moody’s weighs different factors in their rating assessment, which can inform your own credit analysis framework.
