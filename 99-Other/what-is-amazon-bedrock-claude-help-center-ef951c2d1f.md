What is Amazon Bedrock?

# What is Amazon Bedrock?

Updated this week

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing

foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like Anthropic through a single API,

along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with

security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can easily experiment

with and evaluate Anthropic’s Claude models for your use case, privately customize

them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented

Generation (RAG), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems

and data sources. Since Amazon Bedrock is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.

You can learn more about Anthropic’s Claude models in Amazon Bedrock [here](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/).
