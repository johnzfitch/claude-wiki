There are several reasons your card may have been declined when trying to process this transaction. While we don't receive detailed information from issuing banks regarding the specific reasons for a decline, there are several common factors that may contribute to this issue. A few ideas to try are:

## Ensure Supported Billing Location

Please review our list of [supported billing locations](https://www.anthropic.com/supported-countries) to confirm that your payment method's billing address and origin country are eligible for processing. Ensure that your payment method’s billing address matches the origin country.

## Verify Billing Address

Ensure that the billing address associated with your payment method matches the address on file with your bank. Even minor discrepancies, such as a missing accent mark or a misspelled street name, can trigger a decline.

## Complete 3DS Verification (if applicable)

If your transaction requires 3D Secure (3DS) verification, ensure that you have successfully completed the authentication process. This may involve entering a one-time password sent to your registered mobile device or confirming the transaction through your bank's app or website.

## Use an Accepted Payment Method

We accept credit cards and debit cards for all purchases. For API accounts on monthly invoicing, we also accept to ACH bank transfers.

Please note that we do not accept third-party payment processors such as PayPal or Venmo. If you attempt to use an unsupported payment method, your transaction will likely be declined.

## Confirm Sufficient Funds

Verify that your payment method has sufficient funds to cover the total amount of your purchase. If you're unsure about your account balance, we recommend contacting your bank directly for assistance.

## Retry the Payment

If you have access to another payment method, consider using it to complete your purchase. It may be worthwhile to attempt the transaction again at a later time as temporary technical issues or network disruptions can sometimes cause declines, which may resolve on their own.

## Contact Your Bank

Reach out to your issuing bank directly to inquire about the reason for the decline. They may be able to provide additional information or insights that can help you resolve the issue.

If you've tried the troubleshooting steps above and are still encountering difficulties, please don't hesitate to [contact our support team](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) for further assistance.
