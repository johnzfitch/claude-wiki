Understanding Claude's capabilities
Which model am I talking to?

The model you're currently chatting with is displayed below your text input. Free users can’t adjust this, but users on paid plans can toggle between different models using the model selector.

 

Can I chat with Claude in different languages?

Claude has extensive training in English and performs well in many other common languages. It also has some ability to communicate in less common languages and has extensive knowledge of programming languages.

 

For instructions to select a language in your settings, see How to use Claude in your preferred language.

 

Are there any usage limits or limits on chat length?

While using the free Claude plan, there is a session-based usage limit that will reset every five hours. Also, the number of messages you can send will vary based on demand, and we may impose other types of usage limits to ensure fair access to all users. Claude will notify you when you’ve reached your limit, or if your prompt exceeds the available context window.
