## What is Claude for Nonprofits?

Claude for Nonprofits enhances Claude with specialized capabilities for mission-driven organizations. It connects Claude to the donor management platforms, foundation research databases, and collaboration tools nonprofits use daily, eliminating the need to toggle between systems and enabling insights that span your entire operational ecosystem to accelerate mission delivery while maintaining the transparency and accountability critical to social impact work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Our nonprofit program pricing is available to qualifying nonprofits with 501(c)(3) designation or equivalent international designations. We also include K-12 public & private schools in our nonprofit pricing.

Additionally, mission-based healthcare organizations with 501(c)(3) status may qualify, including independent Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) and Rural Emergency Hospitals (REHs) not part of larger health systems, HRSA-designated Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and FQHC Look-Alikes, and CMS-certified Rural Health Clinics (RHCs).

### Who is not eligible?

At this time, the following organizations are not eligible:

- Government agencies

- Political organizations or campaigns

- Higher education institutions

- Healthcare systems and hospitals

- Organizations that conflict with the anti-discrimination policies of our verification partner

### What's the process to get validated?

**For Enterprise plans:** When you click "Contact Sales," our nonprofit sales team will verify your 501(c)(3) or equivalent nonprofit status as part of the sales conversation.

**For Team plans (self-serve):** You'll be directed to our validation partner, Goodstack, to verify your nonprofit status. This process should take no more than 2-3 minutes. Once approved, you'll receive an email to complete your account setup with nonprofit pricing automatically applied.

1.  Validate your nonprofit organization status through the [Goodstack form](https://validate.poweredbypercent.com/anthropic):

    [](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1859550134/3415c95777759fcd2fa1f2c452a9/7a6e1fc2-94e9-4dc5-90aa-b72ef769a934?expires=1770585300&signature=523640dbcc6c49f371fe6d800eaeeb7709adabeda6bdc0f2e0c910f1611387d9&req=dSgiH8x7nYBcXfMW1HO4zdZi8VdczjviauxJI2ssEtdfE%2BVT6BJum%2FmY%2BChc%0AQzxI%0A)

2.  If you match our nonprofit eligibility criteria, you should receive an email from Anthropic confirming your eligibility.

3.  Follow the link in the email to sign up on this page using your Goodstack verified email address. You must sign up using the email you verified with Goodstack.

    [](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1859550858/a8e7833485a9306ef355ede135d9/0a6664d1-a09c-4790-86ec-d1d6d71cd5b5?expires=1770585300&signature=5bacfa282d55c2a53d8cbed15b01f0fddc49cedd50527d5af44ddc26ade2311f&req=dSgiH8x7nYlaUfMW1HO4zUHP%2FK91mnEmKfBwVdbHuxmrsSvKqEwrsxg58TQe%0AqFa%2B%0A)

4.  Click ‘With my team’ and fill in your details to set up your Team plan account:

    [](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1859551642/ca5be89a4c185449daf6152097ad/cc2254e9-fe79-449c-92c0-f5acc91e1f03?expires=1770585300&signature=d53ef05d5e2dfeb5b7b872d75eb975054c9435aa624efd468d4ae38c745fc251&req=dSgiH8x7nIdbW%2FMW1HO4zbZSFBwXSV6grg0IMwuRgituWLLAE8hJctKvUV9z%0A%2FDPr%0A)

### How long will the nonprofit discount apply to my organization?

The nonprofit discount remains active on your account as long as your organization maintains eligible nonprofit status. You do not need to reapply annually. However, Anthropic reserves the right to periodically verify nonprofit status. If your organization's status changes (e.g., loss of 501(c)(3) designation or equivalent), please notify Anthropic so your account can be adjusted accordingly.

### Why wasn’t my nonprofit verified for a discount?

Anthropic partners with Goodstack to validate nonprofit eligibility criteria. If you have questions about your application, please [contact Goodstack here](https://help.goodstack.org/hc/en-us).

### What do I do if I already have a full priced account?

If you already have a paid Team plan account on your nonprofit organization email and qualify for nonprofit pricing, please follow these steps:

1.  Cancel your plan by navigating to [Admin settings \> Billing](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/billing) and clicking “Cancel.”

    1.  Note that only organization Owners and Primary Owners have this ability.

2.  Wait until the current subscription expires.

    1.  If you're on an annual plan, [reach out our Support team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) with your organization name, nonprofit verification status, and current subscription details for assistance with switching to nonprofit pricing.

3.  Verify your nonprofit status via [Goodstack](https://validate.poweredbypercent.com/anthropic).

4.  Once verified, follow the email instructions to re-subscribe with your verified email address.

**Note:** Your existing Team plan account data will be retained after canceling, so resubscribing with the same email address will restore that data.

If you already have a paid Enterprise account on your nonprofit organization email, [please contact sales](https://claude.com/contact-sales/nonprofits).

### Can the nonprofit discount apply to a Team organization that already has Premium seats?

Yes, the nonprofit discount can be applied to an existing Team plan. If your organization already has a Team plan with Premium seats, click your initials, then "Get help" to [reach out our Support team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) with your organization details and nonprofit verification. Our team can help apply the discounted rate to the existing subscription moving forward. Note that the discount will apply to future billing cycles; retroactive refunds for periods before verification are not typically provided.

### Do all of the email addresses added to the Team plan need to use the same domain?

No, Team plans do not require all members to have the same email domain. Admins can invite users with any email address to join their Team plan, as long the [domain is added in **Allowed email domains**](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13325567-account-management-faqs#h_b54c41c86c)**.** This is helpful for nonprofits that work with volunteers, contractors, or partner organizations who may use different email domains. However, we recommend using organizational emails when possible for security and administrative purposes.

### My Claude account was created with a different email address from my nonprofit organization; how can I retain or migrate my data when switching to a nonprofit Team plan?

Currently, there is no automated migration path for conversation history between accounts. If you're added to a nonprofit Team plan organization using a different email address, you can export any important information from your original account manually before discontinuing use and switching to the new nonprofit organization.

### How does Claude integrate with our existing nonprofit tools?

Claude offers purpose-built integrations with leading nonprofit platforms including Microsoft 365, Candid, Blackbaud, Asana, and other sector-specific tools through our MCP (Model Context Protocol) partnerships. These integrations allow Claude to work seamlessly within your existing workflows - from grant writing in your CRM to program evaluation in your data platforms - without requiring technical expertise or custom development.

See more on how to set up connectors [here](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11724452-using-the-connectors-directory-to-extend-claude-s-capabilities).

### How does Claude handle our data and privacy?

As with all Team and Enterprise plan accounts, data shared with Claude is kept private: by default, we don’t use it to train our models. Claude maintains SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA-readiness, and our connectors don’t access anything that you haven’t explicitly granted them permission to. See our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.claude.com/en/collections/10672411-data-handling-retention) for additional details.

For detailed information on our security practices and compliance certifications, visit our [Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com/).

### What's the difference between the Team plan and the Enterprise plan for nonprofits?

The Team plan is perfect for smaller nonprofits or individual departments, supporting up to 20 users with collaborative workspaces and SSO. This is available self-serve, please fill out [this short form](https://validate.poweredbypercent.com/anthropic) to verify.

The Enterprise plan is designed for larger organizations needing advanced features like custom data retention policies, expanded context windows for complex documents, SCIM provisioning, and dedicated success management.

### What do I do if my organization has fewer than five employees?

Currently, we do not offer discounts for organizations looking for fewer than five seats. However, we do provide several resources to help you get started with AI:

- [AI Fluency for Nonprofits course](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-for-nonprofits) – *a comprehensive virtual course with lessons that take you from onboarding to an AI platform to how to prompt to how to incorporate AI into your flows*

- [AI Use Cases for Nonprofits](https://claude.com/resources/use-cases/category/nonprofits) – *individual guides for seven use cases that nonprofits commonly work on.*

These resources have been developed in partnership with Giving Tuesday and are tailored for nonprofits. We hope that they can support you as your organization begins to adopt AI to accelerate your impact.

### I’m a tax-exempt nonprofit. How do I have tax removed from my invoice?

Because we do not have a way to proactively apply Sales tax exemption, when setting up your organization’s account for the first time, you will get charged tax by default. Once you purchase, the process to get that tax refunded and removed from all future purchases is to email your Sales tax exempt form using the “Get Help” button in your Claude account (more information on this [here](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support)).

1.  Once logged into your account, click on your profile and select “Get help”:

    [](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1859539953/597e1f19c60656e83c1837bb8f58/378309b4-8aac-4ca0-8e5a-8dbaad5421fa?expires=1770585300&signature=e1b9f529e348855aa8c0c034b6b8ec559634e4a604080d553b6bce0398a147c5&req=dSgiH8x9lIhaWvMW1HO4zXOOyvbHyn%2B3euk4zq7weKAL12kmxp2wDBEPTeWc%0AANlJ%0A)

2.  Next under “Messages”, click “Send us a message":

    [](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1859540669/dea0231fbbeb497049cd83fbbb0c/f18b8af9-1621-45cf-8961-55aad08561eb?expires=1770585300&signature=c02a2f2aed47de0052b21132625796e3d405657b77f4519b028ff3d6ff7f5c3b&req=dSgiH8x6nYdZUPMW1HO4zQgqkWNktVQr8Dcdz%2Fuy4laR1%2FjL9bBoDUlv3IIF%0ACaZf%0A)

3.  Accept the conditions:

    [](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1859541804/ce534de604e9de751f9a0133e40d/ccd6ddf2-4912-4e13-9820-b8e39e31e6aa?expires=1770585300&signature=abc765776c7f4e313befdec7c0fbc3b81e7eba9f474a2fa38bbcea879b803712&req=dSgiH8x6nIlfXfMW1HO4zS9v2pQ22gqjRUfBF6HehmSkLppdq4rQapA3JBJR%0ALzT3%0A)

4.  Send a message saying something along the lines of “I was charged tax, but am tax exempt. I would like to submit my Sales tax exemption certificate for upload.”

5.  Please attach your Sales tax exemption certificate as a pdf to this message.

6.  Support will respond to your message letting you know that they’ve received your certificate and that it has been forwarded to our Billing team for review.

    1.  If you’re reaching out on behalf of your organization, please ensure the Owner or Admin on the account is CC’d to the thread

7.  If the Billing team confirms that the certificate is valid, your Sales tax exemption will be applied, and tax accrued for previous invoices within the last 45 days will be refunded to the original payment method. Additionally, **you will not be charged Sales tax on future invoices.**

    1.  If you notice that tax is still being charged going forward, reach back out via Get Help for Support to investigate further.

### What kind of support and training do you provide?

Every nonprofit can access our AI Fluency for Nonprofits course and nonprofit use cases in our [use case library](https://claude.com/resources/use-cases/category/nonprofits), designed specifically for mission-driven organizations. Our [Help Center](https://support.claude.com/en/) is available to all nonprofits for most commonly asked questions or technical issues that require support.

### How do you measure success for nonprofit partners?

We track both efficiency metrics and mission advancement indicators. This includes traditional metrics like user adoption rates and time saved, but more importantly, mission-specific outcomes like increase in beneficiaries served, improvement in program outcome measurements, growth in funding secured, and enhancement in stakeholder engagement scores. We work with each enterprise partner to establish baseline metrics and track progress quarterly, sharing aggregated insights across our nonprofit community to drive sector-wide learning.

## Troubleshooting

### I followed the email link but am not seeing the discounted rate.

If the discounted rate does not appear after using the emailed discount link, follow these steps:

1.  Try clearing your browser cache and cookies, then attempt to sign up again using the original link.

2.  Ensure you're not already signed into an existing Claude account, as this may cause conflicts.

3.  Try using an incognito/private browser window to complete signup.

4.  If issues persist, click your initials, then "Get help" to [reach out our Support team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) with the following details: organization name, email address used for sign up, the discount link they received, and any error messages displayed. Support can manually verify the discount was applied or assist with troubleshooting.

### In cases where the Team plan option is greyed out or not selectable, what is the recommended support path?

When the Team plan option appears greyed out, this typically indicates one of the following:

1.  The user may already be associated with an existing Team or organization.

2.  There may be a browser compatibility issue.

3.  The discount link may have expired or been used previously.

**Recommended steps:**

1.  First, try a different browser or incognito mode.

2.  If the issue persists, click your initials, then "Get help" to [reach out our Support team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) with a screenshot of the greyed-out option and your email address. Support can investigate whether there are account conflicts and assist with resolution.
