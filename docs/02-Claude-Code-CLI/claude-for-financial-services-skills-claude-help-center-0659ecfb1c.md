## PPT Template Creator

This Skill works differently from the others listed here. Rather than producing a financial deliverable, it creates a reusable custom skill from your firm's existing PowerPoint template—so that future presentations generated by Claude match your firm's branding, layouts, and formatting standards.

**How it works:** You provide a PowerPoint template (.pptx or .potx) and the Skill analyzes its layouts, placeholder positions, dimensions, and formatting conventions. It then packages these into a custom skill you can enable in your settings. Once enabled, that custom skill generates presentations matching your template whenever relevant.

**What you need:**

- Your firm's PowerPoint template file (.pptx or .potx)

**What you get:**

- A reusable custom skill configured to your firm's template specifications

- Validated sample presentation confirming correct layout and formatting

**Note:** This Skill produces a skill, not a presentation. To generate actual presentations using your template, enable the custom skill it creates and use it in subsequent conversations. Learn more about custom skills in [How to create custom Skills](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Presentation Quality Checker

**Suggested data sources:**

- User-provided presentation files (.pptx)

**Key outputs:**

- Specific slide-level flagging with recommended fixes

- Severity-ranked action items for revision

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strip Profile/Business Overview Creation

## How to use these Skills

Claude for Financial Services Skills work automatically when relevant to your task. You don’t need to explicitly invoke them—Claude determines when each Skill is needed based on your request.

For example, if you ask Claude to “Create a DCF model for Company XYZ,” Claude will automatically use the DCF modeling Skill. Similarly, asking for “comps analysis for ABC Corp” will trigger the comps analysis Skill.

To guarantee Claude uses the skill, you are also welcome to explicitly instruct Claude to use the skill. For example, append “please use DCF skill” to the prompt.

## Best Practices

- **Be specific about your requirements:** Clearly state the company name, analysis type, and any specific parameters you need.

- **Provide context:** Share relevant details like industry, time period, or specific metrics you want to focus on.

- **Review and refine:** After Claude generates output using a Skill, you can ask for adjustments or additional analysis.

- **Leverage multiple Skills:** Many workflows benefit from using several Skills together—for example, using the research Skill to initiate coverage, then the DCF Skill for valuation.
