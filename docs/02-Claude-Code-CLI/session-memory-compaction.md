# Session Memory Compaction

Long-running conversations with Claude can exceed context limits,
causing loss of important information. Whether you\'re building a coding
assistant, creative writing tool, or customer service agent, managing
session memory is critical for maintaining continuity and quality.

This cookbook teaches you how to **proactively manage session memory**
to avoid jarring context limit interruptions. Unlike reactive approaches
that wait until the context is full, you\'ll learn to build session
memory in the background so compaction is instant when needed.

**Related:** For automatic SDK-based compaction in agentic workflows,
see [Automatic Context
Compaction](../tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb). This
cookbook focuses on manual control patterns for conversational
applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this cookbook, you will be able to:

- Write effective session memory prompts that preserve critical context
  across compaction events
- Implement **instant compaction** using background threading to
  eliminate user wait time
- Apply prompt caching to reduce the cost of background memory updates
  by \~80%
- Choose appropriate compaction strategies (traditional vs. instant)
  based on your use case

Compress the conversation into a structured summary
that preserves all information needed to continue work seamlessly. Optimize for the assistant's
ability to continue working, not human readability.

<analysis-instructions>
Before generating your summary, analyze the transcript in <think>...</think> tags:
1. What did the user originally request? (Exact phrasing)
2. What actions succeeded? What failed and why?
3. Did the user correct or redirect the assistant at any point?
4. What was actively being worked on at the end?
5. What tasks remain incomplete or pending?
6. What specific details (IDs, paths, values, names) must survive compression?
</analysis-instructions>

<summary-format>
## User Intent
The user's original request and any refinements. Use direct quotes for key requirements.
If the user's goal evolved during the conversation, capture that progression.

## Completed Work
Actions successfully performed. Be specific:
- What was created, modified, or deleted
- Exact identifiers (file paths, record IDs, URLs, names)
- Specific values, configurations, or settings applied

## Errors & Corrections
- Problems encountered and how they were resolved
- Approaches that failed (so they aren't retried)
- User corrections: "don't do X", "actually I meant Y", "that's wrong because..."
Capture corrections verbatim—these represent learned preferences.

## Active Work
What was in progress when the session ended. Include:
- The specific task being performed
- Direct quotes showing exactly where work left off
- Any partial results or intermediate state

## Pending Tasks
Remaining items the user requested that haven't been started.
Distinguish between "explicitly requested" and "implied/assumed."

## Key References
Important details needed to continue:
- Identifiers: IDs, paths, URLs, names, keys
- Values: numbers, dates, configurations, credentials (redacted)
- Context: relevant background information, constraints, preferences
- Citations: sources referenced during the conversation
</summary-format>

<preserve-rules>
Always preserve when present:

- Error messages verbatim
- User corrections and negative feedback
- Specific values, formulas, or configurations
- Technical constraints or requirements discovered
- The precise state of any in-progress work
</preserve-rules>

<compression-rules>
- Weight recent messages more heavily—the end of the transcript is the active context
- Omit pleasantries, acknowledgments, and filler ("Sure!", "Great question")
- Omit system context that will be re-injected separately

### Code example using traditional compacting

In traditional compaction, you generate one summary once the token
threshold is reached. Traditional compaction is slow: when you hit the
context limit, you wait for a summary.

    # Three Mystery Plot Ideas

    ## 1. **The Vanishing Choir**

    **Setup:** In the sleepy town of Millbrook, the entire church choir—twelve people ranging from teenagers to retirees—disappears during their weekly Thursday night practice. The church was locked from the inside, their belongings left behind, including phones and car keys. No signs of struggle, no broken windows. Just an empty sanctuary and sheet music scattered across the floor.

    **The Twist:** Your young detective discovers the choir members didn't disappear—they're hiding. Twenty years ago, they witnessed the town's beloved mayor commit a hit-and-run that killed a drifter. They stayed silent, bound by threats and their own complicity. Now the mayor is dying and has hired someone to ensure his secret dies with him. The choir staged their own disappearance to draw attention and finally confess, but the detective must figure out who they're hiding from before the killer finds them first.

    **Why it works:** Small-town secrets, a ticking clock, and the moral complexity of people who aren't quite innocent or guilty. The locked-room mystery becomes a desperate act of exposure rather than concealment.

    ---

    ## 2. **The Memory Thief**

    **Setup:** Elderly residents in Hartwood are reporting identical "robberies"—but nothing is actually stolen. Instead, they insist specific memories have been taken: a first kiss, a wedding day, the birth of a child. The police dismiss it as dementia until the detective notices a pattern: all victims visited the same new "reminiscence therapist" who uses experimental techniques to help seniors preserve their memories before they fade.

    User: I don't like those ideas, can you think of one plot something more unique and unexpected?

    Assistant: 
    # **The Cartographer's Grave**

    **Setup:** Your young detective arrives in the mountain town of Ridgeway to investigate what seems like a prank: someone has been systematically correcting the town's street signs, storefront addresses, and property markers—changing them by just one or two numbers. The post office is going insane. Mail is being misdelivered. Emergency services are getting lost. But here's the thing: the "corrections" match a 150-year-old town map that was supposedly drawn incorrectly by a disgraced surveyor who was run out of town and buried in an unmarked grave.

    **The Investigation:** The detective discovers the old surveyor wasn't wrong—he was *right*. The town founders deliberately falsified all records after his death, shifting every address, every property line, every boundary marker. Why? Because the real map would reveal that the town's most valuable land—now home to the founding families' estates, the town hall, the historic church—was actually purchased from a Native American family who were supposed to retain mineral rights and a percentage of all profits in perpetuity. 

    **The Twist:** The person "correcting" the signs isn't a descendant of the surveyor or the Native family. It's a twelve-year-old girl with terminal cancer who found the original map in her grandmother's attic. She's not seeking revenge or restitution—she just became obsessed with the idea that the whole town has been living a lie written into the ground itself. Before she dies, she wants the truth to physically exist in the world, even if no one acknowledges it. She's been sneaking out at night with a screwdriver and homemade signs.

    **The Real Mystery:** The detective must decide what to do when they realize that "solving" the case—stopping the girl and restoring the false addresses—means choosing comfortable order over inconvenient truth. Meanwhile, members of the founding families are getting desperate to stop the corrections before anyone looks too closely at land deeds, and the girl's nightly trips are getting increasingly dangerous.

    **Why it works:** It subverts the detective genre by making the "crime" an act of radical honesty. The mystery isn't whodunit—it's what truth is worth when it would destroy an entire community's foundation. The villain isn't the child or even really the founding families—it's the town itself, built on a literal lie. And your detective can't punch or outwit their way out of a moral knot.

    # The Detective: Building Your Protagonist

    ## Core Identity

    Let's call her **Nora Winters** (adjust the name as you prefer). She's 26 years old, which makes her young enough to be underestimated but old enough to have scars.

    ## Backstory

    **The Personal Lie:** Nora grew up in a different small town where her father was the police chief—respected, beloved, the kind of man who coached Little League and knew everyone's name. When she was sixteen, she discovered he'd been planting evidence on suspects for years. Not major crimes—small-town stuff. A little weed here, stolen property there. Just enough to "help" cases along when he "knew" someone was guilty but couldn't prove it.

    She confronted him. He told her the truth was "complicated," that sometimes you have to bend the rules to protect people, that the town trusted him to keep them safe and he delivered results. He made her complicit with his confession—if she exposed him, she'd destroy their family, his legacy, the town's faith in law enforcement.

    She stayed silent. For two years, she carried it like a stone in her chest.

    **The Breaking Point:** At eighteen, one of her father's frame jobs went wrong. A kid he planted drugs on—a 19-year-old with priors who was actually clean this time—panicked during arrest and ran. Got hit by a car. Died in the street.

    - Establishes the town: population 3,200, nestled in mountain valley, tourism from fall foliage and "historic charm"
    - She meets Town Manager **Gerald Vance** (55, anxious, sweating through his shirt despite the cold) at town hall
    - He explains the crisis: for three weeks, someone's been changing street signs and address numbers—small changes, but creating chaos
    - Mail misdelivered, ambulance went to wrong house (patient survived, barely), legal documents being contested
    - Shows her examples: the church changed from 847 Oak Street to 843 Oak, the post office from 1215 Main to 1219 Main
    - Gerald thinks it's vandalism, wants her to catch whoever's doing it quickly and quietly
    - **Key detail:** Nora notices all the "corrections" subtract or add small, specific numbers—not random

    # **Chapter 1: Arrival**

    The town of Ridgeway materialized from the fog like a photograph developing in reverse—sharp edges first, then the softer details filling in around them. Church steeple. Water tower. The downtown strip with its brick facades and hand-painted signs promising antiques, locally roasted coffee, genuine mountain crafts. Nora Winters took it all in through rain-spattered windshield glass, her Honda's wipers beating a rhythm that had become hypnotic somewhere around hour five of the drive.

    Small towns always looked the same in October. Like they were apologizing for something.

    She followed Main Street through the heart of downtown—two blocks of calculated charm before the road narrowed and climbed into the residential neighborhoods climbing the mountain's flank. The GPS on her phone had lost signal fifteen minutes ago, but she didn't need it. Town hall would be near the center, probably the biggest building on the main drag, probably with a flag and that particular kind of municipal architecture that tried too hard to look historic.

    She was right on all counts.

    Ridgeway Town Hall occupied a corner lot with the self-importance of a building that had watched the world change and declined to participate. Red brick, white columns, a bronze plaque declaring it built in 1889 and placed on the National Register in 1976. The flag snapped in the wind. Rain pooled in the uneven sidewalk leading to the entrance.

    Nora parked on the street, grabbed her messenger bag, and made the dash to the covered entrance. The door was heavier than it looked—solid oak, brass hardware—and opened into the particular smell of old public buildings: lemon polish, ancient radiator heat, and paper slowly yellowing in filing cabinets.

    A woman at the reception desk looked up from her computer. Sixty-something, reading glasses on a beaded chain, cardigan against the over-aggressive heating system. Her smile was professional and tired in equal measure.

    Assistant: 
    # **Chapter 2: The Town's Memory**

    Nora woke at six to the sound of rain that had never really stopped, just paused to gather its strength. She'd fallen asleep at the small desk by the window, tablet still glowing with Gerald's documentation, her neck complaining about the angle she'd maintained for however many hours.

    The numbers were still dancing behind her eyes. She'd spent half the night building spreadsheets, mapping the changes, looking for the pattern Gerald had sensed but couldn't articulate. And she'd found it—or the beginning of it. Every changed address was in the older part of town, pre-1900 construction. Every change was small but specific: sometimes adding four, sometimes subtracting two, once adding seven. Not random. Definitely not random.

    She showered, changed into clean jeans and a sweater, and followed the smell of coffee downstairs.

    The dining room was small and warmly lit, with four tables covered in white cloth. An older man sat alone by the window reading a newspaper—actual paper, folded precisely. A younger couple occupied another table, speaking in low voices over their phones. Tourists, Nora guessed, based on the hiking boots and Patagonia fleeces.

    A sideboard held coffee, tea, juice, and a modest breakfast spread. Nora filled a mug and took a table in the corner where she could see the room and the street beyond.

    Dolores appeared from what must have been the kitchen, carrying a plate of scrambled eggs and toast. She set it in front of the man with the newspaper without being asked, received a grunt of acknowledgment, and crossed to Nora's table.

    "You look like you didn't sleep much."

This is a long conversation with several turns. You\'ll notice a few
things here:

Prompt caching: You\'ll notice here that the input tokens eventually
grew to a point where prompt caching was used (turn 6). This helps
reduce costs and speed as these conversations grow!

    User: Propose a title for the book

    Assistant: 
    Based on the story's core themes and imagery, here are my title proposals:

    ## Primary Recommendation

    **The Cartographer's Daughter**

    This works on multiple levels:
    - Emma is metaphorically Amos Frost's "daughter" in mission—inheriting and completing his work
    - Patricia (literal descendant of Frost's assistant) becomes Emma's accomplice
    - Evokes the weight of inheritance, legacy, and what we pass down
    - "Cartographer" immediately signals the map/truth theme
    - Has literary gravitas appropriate for the story's tone

    ## Alternates

You\'ll notice here that it took **over 40 seconds** for the agent to
compact the conversation. Because we used traditional compaction, the
user would be waiting on Claude to compact the conversation, which is
not an ideal user experience.

Below you can see the result of the compaction. It captures the key
elements of conversation in less than 2K tokens.

    ## User Intent
    Create short story about young detective solving mysterious case in small town. Initially requested "3 well thought out plot ideas." Rejected first batch as not unique enough, requested "something more unique and unexpected." Accepted "The Cartographer's Grave" concept. Then requested: character backstory/motivations development, detailed chapter outline, and drafted chapters.

    ## Completed Work

    **Approved Plot: "The Cartographer's Grave"**
    - Ridgeway (pop. 3,200, mountain town) experiencing systematic address changes
    - 12-year-old Emma Lancaster (terminal brain cancer) changing signs at night to match 1874 surveyor Amos Frost's original map
    - Frost was "disgraced," replaced by Marcus Bellamy (founding family) in 1875 re-survey
    - Real conspiracy: Bellamy survey deliberately shifted property lines 200-400 feet east to steal valuable land from Pequawket family (Native American), who had mineral rights + 15% revenue contract
    - Emma found Frost's materials in grandmother's attic (Patricia Lancaster, granddaughter of Samuel Lancaster—Frost's assistant who bought his effects)
    - Emma's motivation: not justice, but existential—wants to matter, leave truth behind before dying
    - Resolution: Town acknowledges historical fraud via memorial/fund, addresses stay changed, Emma dies knowing truth survived

    **Main Character: Nora Winters**
    - Age 26, private investigator for rural cases firm
    - Backstory: Father was police chief who planted evidence for years. At 16 she discovered it, stayed silent 2 years. At 18, a framed kid died fleeing arrest. She exposed father to state police. Father forced into retirement but kept reputation. Family estranged, won't speak to her.
    - Motivation: Prove truth always matters, atone for 2 years of silence
    - Fatal flaw: Prioritizes truth over mercy, can be self-righteous
    - Arc: Must learn truth and justice aren't always same thing

    **Supporting Characters**
    - Gerald Vance (55, town manager, anxious)
    - Dolores Chen (68, Ridgeway Inn owner, knows everything)
    - Ruth Bellamy (72, historical society president, descendant of Marcus Bellamy)
    - Sheriff Tom Whitlock (50, third-generation sheriff, dismissive)
    - Emma Lancaster (12, dying of brain cancer, changing signs)
    - Patricia Lancaster (64, Emma's grandmother, retired town clerk, Samuel Lancaster's descendant)
    - James Pequawket (58, teacher, lives two towns over, descendant)
    - Samuel Lancaster (Amos Frost's 1874 assistant, bought Frost's effects after death)
    - Amos Frost (surveyor, accurate 1874 map, died 1889 in sanitarium, unmarked grave)

    **16-Chapter Outline with Epilogue Created**
    - Act 1 (Ch 1-4): Nora arrives, discovers pattern, identifies Emma via dropped notebook
    - Act 2 (Ch 5-9): Confronts Emma, discovers Frost's journal/map at Lancaster house, uncovers full conspiracy
    - Act 3 (Ch 10-15): Town pressures Nora, founding families threaten charges against Emma, Nora proposes compromise (memorial + fund vs. property transfers), Emma dies December 3rd
    - Epilogue (Ch 16): Six months later, Nora receives Emma's notebook showing new project mapping unmarked graves

    **Chapter 1 Drafted (~2000 words)**
    - Nora arrives Ridgeway in rain, meets Gerald Vance at town hall
    - Gerald explains crisis: 37 locations, professional signs, started October 2nd, systematic pattern
    - Key detail: Changes are small (1-5 numbers) but precise, affecting only pre-1900 buildings
    - Nora checks into Ridgeway Inn, meets Dolores Chen
    - Dolores reveals her address changed October 3rd: 843 to 847 Oak Street, left new sign up to "adapt"
    - Dolores warns: "Be careful asking questions here. Not everyone appreciates having their complications examined."

    **Chapter 2 Drafted**
    - Nora analyzes data overnight, identifies pattern: all changes in pre-1900 areas
    - Breakfast at inn, confronted by Howard Marsh (70s, opposed to investigation)
    - Visits library, meets Jess (librarian, 30, supportive)
    - Discovers in basement archives: changed addresses match 1875 town plat exactly
    - Jess reveals history: Amos Frost surveyed 1874, deemed "inaccurate," dismissed. Marcus Bellamy (Ruth's great-great-grandfather) re-surveyed 1875 (official record). Frost's survey "destroyed years ago."
    - Text from Jess's partner Sarah: Frost died 1889 in sanitarium, pauper's grave. Effects purchased by Samuel Lancaster at 1847 Oak Street.
    - **Chapter ends with revelation**: 1847 Oak = current "corrected" address of Ridgeway Inn (officially 843). Frost's materials likely still at inn. "The question was who in that building knew they existed, and why they'd decided—after more than a century of silence—that the truth needed to be rewritten into the town's streets."

    ## Errors & Corrections
    User explicitly rejected first 3 plot ideas: "The Vanishing Choir," "The Memory Thief," "The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter"—deemed not unique/unexpected enough.

    ## Active Work
    Chapter 2 completed. Story ready to continue with Chapter 3, which per outline should cover "The Pattern" where Nora stakes out locations and first spots Emma changing a sign.

    ## Pending Tasks
    Draft chapters 3-16 and epilogue per approved outline.

    ## Key References
    **Critical addresses**: 843 Oak Street (official) / 847 Oak Street (corrected) = Ridgeway Inn location, Samuel Lancaster's 1874 address
    **Timeline**: October 2nd changes start, story current timeframe October, Emma dies December 3rd, epilogue six months later
    **The fraud mechanics**: Bellamy survey shifted all property lines 200-400 feet east, making Pequawket parcel appear worthless hillside while valuable land (now Bellamy estate, town hall, church) became "legitimately" owned by founding families
    **Pequawket contract terms**: Mineral rights in perpetuity + 15% of all property values/business revenues from specified parcel

## Instant Compaction

With **Instant compaction** the session memory is PROACTIVELY generated
once a soft token threshold is reached.

Once the user triggers a compaction or a hard limit is reached, the
summary is already available, so the user doesn\'t need to wait.

Result: Instant compaction, no waiting.

This `InstantCompactingChatSession` class uses **threading** for
background execution:

1.  **`threading.Thread`** - runs memory updates in background without
    blocking
2.  **Thread-safe state** - uses `threading.Lock` to safely update
    shared memory
3.  **Daemon threads** - background work doesn\'t prevent program exit
4.  **Instant compaction** - when context is full, just swap in the
    pre-built memory

## Advanced: Understanding Prompt Caching
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
The background updates can be made **\~10x cheaper** by using prompt
caching. The trick:

1.  Pass the **full conversation** to the background summarizer
2.  Add `cache_control` markers so subsequent requests hit the cache
3.  Only the new \"summarize this\" instruction is billed at full price

    ◆ = cache_control breakpoint (cache everything before this point)

### Why this matters for compaction

  Scenario       Cost per background update   Notes
  -------------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------------
  No caching     Full input cost              5,000 tokens × \$3/M = \$0.015
  With caching   \~10% of input cost          500 new + 4,500 cached = \$0.003
  **Savings**    **\~80%**                    Compounds over many updates

The longer the conversation, the bigger the savings---exactly when you
need compaction most!
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
### How the Caching Works

The key is in `_add_cache_control()` and
`_create_session_memory_cached()`:

``` python
# 1. Mark the last conversation message with cache_control
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [{
        "type": "text",
        "text": msg["content"],
        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}  # <-- This creates a cache breakpoint
    }]
}

# 2. Also mark the system prompt
system=[{
    "type": "text",
    "text": "You are a session memory agent...",
    "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}
}]
```

**Why this works:**

- The first background update creates a cache entry for
  `[System + Messages]`
- Subsequent updates with the same message prefix get **cache hits**
- Only the new summarization instruction is billed at full price
- Cache entries have a 5-minute TTL, so rapid updates benefit most

**Cost math:**

- Without caching: 5,000 tokens × \$3.00/1M = \$0.015 per update
- With caching: 500 new tokens × \$3.00/1M + 4,500 cached × \$0.30/1M =
  \$0.00285
- **Savings: \~80%** on background summarization costs

## Conclusion

In this cookbook, you learned how to manage long-running Claude
conversations through session memory compaction.

### What We Covered

✅ **Effective compaction prompts** - Structure your session memory to
preserve user intent, completed work, errors, active work, and key
references while discarding filler

✅ **Instant compaction** - Use background threading to proactively
build session memory, eliminating user wait time when context limits are
reached

✅ **Prompt caching for cost savings** - Reduce background update costs
by \~80% by reusing the conversation prefix cache

✅ **Traditional vs. instant patterns** - Understand when to use each
approach based on your application needs

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Weight recency heavily** - The end of a conversation is the active
    working context
2.  **Preserve user corrections verbatim** - Prevents the model from
    reverting to old behaviors
3.  **Build memory proactively** - Don\'t wait for context limits; start
    background updates early
4.  **Leverage prompt caching** - Background summarization can share
    cache with the main conversation

### Next Steps

- **For agentic workflows**: See [Automatic Context
  Compaction](../tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb) for
  SDK-based automatic compaction with tool use
- **For production**: Consider persisting session memory to disk rather
  than keeping it in memory
- **For optimization**: Experiment with update frequency thresholds to
  balance cost vs. freshness
