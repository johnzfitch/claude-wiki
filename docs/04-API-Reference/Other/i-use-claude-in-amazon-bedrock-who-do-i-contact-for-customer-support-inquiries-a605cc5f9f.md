How can I get a refund for my usage through Amazon Bedrock?

If you're using Claude through AWS Bedrock, your usage is non-refundable. If you are a customer with a private offer and direct contract with Anthropic for your Bedrock usage, you can reach out to your Anthropic relationship manager for additional assistance.

Note: For Japanese Customers using Bedrock, Anthropic will register for Japanese Consumption Tax once it becomes a Japanese Consumption Taxpayer by exceeding the legal thresholds (at the earliest as of FY2026).
