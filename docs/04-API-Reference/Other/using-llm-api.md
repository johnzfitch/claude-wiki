# Using the Wolfram Alpha LLM API as a Tool with Claude

In this recipe, we\'ll show you how to integrate the Wolfram Alpha LLM
API as a tool for Claude to use. Claude will be able to send queries to
the Wolfram Alpha API and receive computed responses, which it can then
use to provide answers to user questions.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 1: Set up the environment

First, let\'s install the required libraries and set up the Claude API
client. We also will need to set our APP ID for using WolframAlpha. You
can sign up and create a new App ID for this project for free
[here](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/access).
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
import json
import urllib.parse

import requests
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

# Replace 'YOUR_APP_ID' with your actual Wolfram Alpha AppID
WOLFRAM_APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID"
MODEL_NAME = "claude-haiku-4-5"
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 2: Define the Wolfram Alpha LLM API tool

We\'ll define a tool that allows Claude to send queries to the Wolfram
Alpha LLM API and receive the computed response.
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
import urllib.parse

import requests


def wolfram_alpha_query(query):
    # URL-encode the query
    encoded_query = urllib.parse.quote(query)

    # Make a request to the Wolfram Alpha LLM API
    url = (
        f"https://www.wolframalpha.com/api/v1/llm-api?input={encoded_query}&appid={WOLFRAM_APP_ID}"
    )
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=30)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text
    else:
        return f"Error: {response.status_code}: {response.text}"


tools = [
    {
        "name": "wolfram_alpha",
        "description": "A tool that allows querying the Wolfram Alpha knowledge base. Useful for mathematical calculations, scientific data, and general knowledge questions.",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "search_query": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The query to send to the Wolfram Alpha API.",
                }
            },
            "required": ["query"],
        },
    }
]
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
In this code, we define a wolfram_alpha_query function that takes a
query as input, URL-encodes it, and sends a request to the Wolfram Alpha
LLM API using the provided AppID. The function returns the computed
response from the API if the request is successful, or an error message
if there\'s an issue.

We then define the wolfram_alpha tool with an input schema that expects
a single query property of type string.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Step 3: Interact with Claude

Now, let\'s see how Claude can interact with the Wolfram Alpha tool to
answer user questions.
:::

    print(f"\n{'=' * 50}\nUser Message: {user_message}\n{'=' * 50}")
    prompt = f"""Here is a question: {user_message}. Please use the Wolfram Alpha tool to answer it. Do not reflect on the quality of the returned search results in your response."""

        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    )

    print("\nInitial Response:")
    print(f"Stop Reason: {message.stop_reason}")
    print(f"Content: {message.content}")

    if message.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        tool_use = next(block for block in message.content if block.type == "tool_use")

        tool_input = tool_use.input

        print(f"\nTool Used: {tool_name}")
        print("Tool Input:")
        print(json.dumps(tool_input, indent=2))

        tool_result = process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input)

        print("\nTool Result:")
        print(str(json.dumps(tool_result, indent=2)))

        response = client.beta.tools.messages.create(
            model=MODEL_NAME,
            max_tokens=2000,
            tools=tools,
            messages=[

                {"role": "assistant", "content": message.content},
                {

                        {
                            "type": "tool_result",
                            "tool_use_id": tool_use.id,
                            "content": str(tool_result),
                        }
                    ],
                },
            ],
        )

        print("\nResponse:")
        print(f"Stop Reason: {response.stop_reason}")
        print(f"Content: {response.content}")
    else:
        response = message

    final_response = None
    for block in response.content:
        if hasattr(block, "text"):
            final_response = block.text
            break

    print(f"\nFinal Response: {final_response}")

    return final_response
```

to Wolfram Alpha.
