For our API users, we currently maintain three main resources:

Our Client Software Development Kits (SDKs);

Our Claude Docs; and

Our community Discord where developers can share ideas and exchange tips. 

If you need to contact our Support team, you can do so by clicking on the message icon in the bottom right of our Help Center, or by clicking your initials in the lower left corner of your Claude Console account, then "Get help."
