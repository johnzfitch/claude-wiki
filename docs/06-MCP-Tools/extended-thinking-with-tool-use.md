# Extended Thinking with Tool Use

This notebook demonstrates how to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet\'s extended
thinking feature with tools. The extended thinking feature allows you to
see Claude\'s step-by-step thinking before it provides a final answer,
providing transparency into how it decides which tools to use and how it
interprets tool results.

When using extended thinking with tool use, the model will show its
thinking before making tool requests, but not repeat the thinking
process after receiving tool results. Claude will not output another
thinking block until after the next non-`tool_result` `user` turn. For
more information on extended thinking, see our
[documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).

## Setup

First, let\'s install the necessary packages and set up our environment.

## Preserving thinking blocks

When working with extended thinking and tools, make sure to:

1.  **Preserve thinking block signatures**: Each thinking block contains
    a cryptographic signature that validates the conversation context.
    These signatures must be included when passing thinking blocks back
    to Claude.

2.  **Avoid modifying prior context**: The API will reject requests if
    any previous content (including thinking blocks) is modified when
    submitting a new request with tool results.

3.  **Handle both thinking and redacted_thinking blocks**: Both types of
    blocks must be preserved in the conversation history, even if the
    content of redacted blocks is not human readable.

For more details on extended thinking without tools, see the main
\"Extended Thinking\" notebook.

    === INITIAL RESPONSE ===
    Response contains:
    - 1 thinking blocks
    - 1 tool use blocks

    Tool called: weather
    Location to check: Berlin
    Tool result: {'temperature': 60, 'condition': 'Foggy'}

    === TEST 1: WITHOUT thinking block ===
    ERROR: Error code: 400 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'message': 'messages.1.content.0.type: Expected `thinking` or `redacted_thinking`, but found `tool_use`. When `thinking` is enabled, a final `assistant` message must start with a thinking block (preceeding the lastmost set of `tool_use` and `tool_result` blocks). We recommend you include thinking blocks from previous turns. To avoid this requirement, disable `thinking`. Please consult our documentation at https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking'}}
    This demonstrates that thinking blocks must be preserved

    === TEST 2: WITH thinking block (correct approach) ===
    SUCCESS: Response received with thinking blocks included

    Second response contains:
    - 0 thinking blocks
    - 1 text blocks

    Final answer: Currently in Berlin, it's foggy with a temperature of 60°F (about 15.5°C).

    Note: The second response after tool use doesn't contain thinking blocks.
    This is expected behavior - thinking is shown before tool use but not after receiving tool results.

## Conclusion

This notebook shows how to combine Claude\'s extended thinking feature
with tool use. Key benefits include:

1.  Transparency into Claude\'s thinking process when using tools
2.  Visibility into how Claude decides when to use tools versus internal
    knowledge
3.  Better understanding of multi-step tasks that involve multiple tool
    calls
4.  Insight into how Claude interprets tool results and incorporates
    them into responses

When using extended thinking with tools, keep in mind:

- Set appropriate thinking budgets for complex tasks (minimum 1,024
  tokens)
- Always preserve thinking blocks and their signatures when passing tool
  results
- Include both normal and redacted thinking blocks in the conversation
  history
- Ensure that system prompts, tools, and thinking configurations match
  between calls
- Expect that tool result turns will not contain additional thinking
  blocks
- Tool use and thinking together can increase token usage and response
  time
