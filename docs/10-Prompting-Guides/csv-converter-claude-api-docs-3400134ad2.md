## 

Example Output

Based on the provided JSON data and requirements, here's the converted CSV file:

csv

``` shiki
"name";"age";"city";"email"
"John Doe";"30";"New York";"john.doe@example.com"
"Jane Smith";"25";"London";"jane.smith@example.com"
"Bob Johnson";"35";"Paris";"bob.johnson@example.com"
```

Explanation:

- The first line of the CSV file contains the column headers: "name", "age", "city", and "email", separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (").
- Each subsequent line represents a row of data, with values separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (").
- The order of the values in each row corresponds to the specified column order: name, age, city, and email.
- Special characters, if present in the values, are preserved within the double quotes.

To save the CSV file:

1.  Copy the CSV data provided above.
2.  Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, or any other plain text editor).
3.  Paste the CSV data into the text editor.
4.  Save the file with a .csv extension (e.g., data.csv).

Note: When opening the CSV file in a spreadsheet application (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets), make sure to specify the correct delimiter (semicolon) and the presence of double quotes around the values to ensure proper formatting.
