## 

Example Output

Corrected Python code:

Python

``` shiki
def calculate_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    average = total / len(nums)
    return average

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print("The average is:", result)
```

Explanation:

1.  Changed the variable name "sum" to "total" to avoid using the built-in Python function "sum()".
2.  Fixed the typo in the print statement, changing "results" to "result" to correctly reference the variable.
