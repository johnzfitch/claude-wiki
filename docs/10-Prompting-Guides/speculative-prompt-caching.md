# Speculative Prompt Caching

This cookbook demonstrates \"Speculative Prompt Caching\" - a pattern
that reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by warming up the cache while
users are still formulating their queries.

**Without Speculative Caching:**

1.  User types their question (3 seconds)
2.  User submits question
3.  API loads context into cache AND generates response

**With Speculative Caching:**

1.  User starts typing (cache warming begins immediately)
2.  User continues typing (cache warming completes in background)
3.  User submits question
4.  API uses warm cache to generate response

## Setup

First, let\'s install the required packages:

## Example 1: Standard Prompt Caching (Without Speculative Caching)

First, let\'s see how standard prompt caching works. The user types
their question, then we send the entire context + question to the API:
:::

::: {#b16e9048 .cell .code execution_count="85"}
``` python
async def standard_prompt_caching_demo():
    client = AsyncAnthropic()

    # Prepare the large context
    initial_message = await create_initial_message()

    # Simulate user typing time (in real app, this would be actual user input)
    print("User is typing their question...")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Simulate 3 seconds of typing
    user_question = "What is the purpose of the BtShared structure?"
    print(f"User submitted: {user_question}")

    # Now send the full request (context + question)
    full_message = copy.deepcopy(initial_message)
    full_message["content"].append(
        {"type": "text", "text": f"Answer the user's question: {user_question}"}
    )

    print("\nSending request to API...")
    start_time = time.time()

    # Measure time to first token
    first_token_time = None
    async with client.messages.stream(
        messages=[full_message],
        model=MODEL,
        **DEFAULT_CLIENT_ARGS,
    ) as stream:
        async for text in stream.text_stream:
            if first_token_time is None and text.strip():
                first_token_time = time.time() - start_time
                print(f"\n🕐 Time to first token: {first_token_time:.2f} seconds")
                break

        # Get the full response
        response = await stream.get_final_message()

    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Total response time: {total_time:.2f} seconds")
    print_query_statistics(response, "Standard Caching")

    return first_token_time, total_time
```

    # Start speculative caching while user is typing

    print("🔥 Starting cache warming in background...")

    # While the user is typing out their question, we sample a single token

    # prompt caching turned on to warm up the cache.
    cache_task = asyncio.create_task(sample_one_token(client, [initial_message]))

    # Simulate user typing time
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Simulate 3 seconds of typing
    user_question = "What is the purpose of the BtShared structure?"
    print(f"User submitted: {user_question}")

    # Ensure cache warming is complete
    await cache_task
    print("✅ Cache warming completed!")

    # Prepare messages for cached query. We make sure we
    # reuse the same initial message as was cached to ensure we have a cache hit.
    cached_message = copy.deepcopy(initial_message)
    cached_message["content"].append(
        {"type": "text", "text": f"Answer the user's question: {user_question}"}
    )

    print("\nSending request to API (with warm cache)...")

## Key Takeaways

1.  **Speculative caching dramatically reduces TTFT** by warming the
    cache while users are typing
2.  **The pattern is most effective** with large contexts (\>1000
    tokens) that are reused across queries
3.  **Implementation is simple** - just send a 1-token request while the
    user is typing
4.  **Cache warming happens in parallel** with user input, effectively
    \"hiding\" the cache creation time

## Best Practices

- Start cache warming as early as possible (e.g., when a user focuses an
  input field)
- Use exactly the same context for warming and actual requests to ensure
  cache hits
- Monitor `cache_read_input_tokens` to verify cache hits
- Add timestamps to prevent unwanted cache sharing across sessions
