# Tool Search with Embeddings: Scaling Claude to Thousands of Tools

Building Claude applications with dozens of specialized tools quickly
hits a wall: providing all tool definitions upfront consumes your
context window, increases latency and costs, and makes it harder for
Claude to find the right tool. Beyond \~100 tools, this approach becomes
impractical.

Semantic tool search solves this by treating tools as discoverable
resources. Instead of front-loading hundreds of definitions, you give
Claude a single `tool_search` tool that returns relevant capabilities on
demand, cutting context usage by 90%+ while enabling applications that
scale to thousands of tools.

**By the end of this cookbook, you\'ll be able to:**

- Implement client-side tool search to scale Claude applications from
  dozens to thousands of tools
- Use semantic embeddings to dynamically discover relevant tools based
  on task context
- Apply this pattern to domain-specific tool libraries (APIs, databases,
  internal systems)

This pattern is used in production by teams managing large tool
ecosystems where context efficiency is critical. While we\'ll
demonstrate with a small set of tools for clarity, the same approach
scales seamlessly to libraries with hundreds or thousands of tools.

## Prerequisites

Before following this guide, ensure you have:

**Required Knowledge**

- Python fundamentals - comfortable with functions, dictionaries, and
  basic data structures
- Basic understanding of Claude tool use - we recommend reading the
  [Tool Use
  Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use)
  first

**Required Tools**

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Anthropic API key ([get one
  here](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api))

## Setup

First, install the required dependencies:
:::

::::: {.cell .code execution_count="68"}
``` python
# Note: we use -q to avoid printing too much to stdout
# Use --only-binary to avoid build issues with pythran
%pip install --only-binary :all: -q anthropic sentence-transformers numpy python-dotenv
```

::: {.output .stream .stderr}
    huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...
    To disable this warning, you can either:
    	- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
    	- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

::: {.output .stream .stdout}
    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
:::
:::::

::: {.cell .markdown}
Ensure your `.env` file contains:

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

Load your environment variables and configure the client:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="69"}
``` python
import json
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import Any

import anthropic
import numpy as np
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Define model constant for easy updates
MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

# Initialize Claude client (API key loaded from environment)
claude_client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Load the SentenceTransformer model
# all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a lightweight model with 384 dimensional embeddings
# It will be downloaded from HuggingFace on first use
print("Loading SentenceTransformer model...")
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

print("✓ Clients initialized successfully")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}
    Loading SentenceTransformer model...
    ✓ Clients initialized successfully

## Define Tool Library

Before we can implement semantic search, we need tools to search
through. We\'ll create a library of 8 tools across two categories:
Weather and Finance.

In production applications, you might manage hundreds or thousands of
tools across your internal APIs, database operations, or third-party
integrations. The semantic search approach scales to these larger
libraries without modification - we\'re using a small set here purely
for demonstration clarity.

## Create Tool Embeddings

Semantic search works by comparing the *meaning* of text, rather than
just searching for keywords. To enable this, we need to convert each
tool definition into an **embedding vector** that captures its semantic
meaning.

Since our tool definitions are structured JSON objects with names,
descriptions, and parameters, we first convert each tool into a
human-readable text representation, then generate embedding vectors
using SentenceTransformer\'s `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

We picked this model because it is:

- **Lightweight and fast** (only 384 dimensions vs 768+ for larger
  models)
- **Runs locally** without requiring API calls
- **Sufficient for tool search** (you can experiment with larger models
  for better accuracy)

Let\'s start by creating a function that converts tool definitions into
searchable text:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="71"}
``` python
def tool_to_text(tool: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """
    Convert a tool definition into a text representation for embedding.
    Combines the tool name, description, and parameter information.
    """
    text_parts = [
        f"Tool: {tool['name']}",
        f"Description: {tool['description']}",
    ]

    # Add parameter information
    if "input_schema" in tool and "properties" in tool["input_schema"]:
        params = tool["input_schema"]["properties"]
        param_descriptions = []
        for param_name, param_info in params.items():
            param_desc = param_info.get("description", "")
            param_type = param_info.get("type", "")
            param_descriptions.append(f"{param_name} ({param_type}): {param_desc}")

        if param_descriptions:
            text_parts.append("Parameters: " + ", ".join(param_descriptions))

    return "\n".join(text_parts)


# Test with one tool
sample_text = tool_to_text(TOOL_LIBRARY[0])
print("Sample tool text representation:")
print(sample_text)
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}
    Sample tool text representation:
    Tool: get_weather
    Description: Get the current weather in a given location
    Parameters: location (string): The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA, unit (string): The unit of temperature
:::
::::

::: {.cell .markdown}
Now let\'s create embeddings for all our tools:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="72"}
``` python
# Create embeddings for all tools
print("Creating embeddings for all tools...")

tool_texts = [tool_to_text(tool) for tool in TOOL_LIBRARY]

# Embed all tools at once using SentenceTransformer
# The model returns normalized embeddings by default
tool_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(tool_texts, convert_to_numpy=True)

print(f"✓ Created embeddings with shape: {tool_embeddings.shape}")
print(f"  - {tool_embeddings.shape[0]} tools")
print(f"  - {tool_embeddings.shape[1]} dimensions per embedding")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}
    Creating embeddings for all tools...
    ✓ Created embeddings with shape: (8, 384)
      - 8 tools
      - 384 dimensions per embedding
:::
::::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Implement Tool Search

With our tools embedded as vectors, we can now implement semantic
search. If two pieces of text have similar meanings, their embedding
vectors will be close together in vector space. We measure this
\"closeness\" using **cosine similarity**.

The search process:

1.  **Embed the query**: Convert Claude\'s natural language search
    request into the same vector space as our tools
2.  **Calculate similarity**: Compute cosine similarity between the
    query vector and each tool vector
3.  **Rank and return**: Sort tools by similarity score and return the
    top N matches

With semantic search, Claude can search using natural language like \"I
need to check the weather\" or \"calculate investment returns\" rather
than exact tool names.

Let\'s implement the search function and test it with a sample query:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="73"}
``` python
def search_tools(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Search for tools using semantic similarity.

    Args:
        query: Natural language description of what tool is needed
        top_k: Number of top tools to return

    Returns:
        List of tool definitions most relevant to the query
    """
    # Embed the query using SentenceTransformer
    query_embedding = embedding_model.encode(query, convert_to_numpy=True)

    # Calculate cosine similarity using dot product
    # SentenceTransformer returns normalized embeddings, so dot product = cosine similarity
    similarities = np.dot(tool_embeddings, query_embedding)

    # Get top k indices
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]

    # Return the corresponding tools with their scores
    results = []
    for idx in top_indices:
        results.append({"tool": TOOL_LIBRARY[idx], "similarity_score": float(similarities[idx])})

    return results


# Test the search function
test_query = "I need to check the weather"
test_results = search_tools(test_query, top_k=3)

print(f"Search query: '{test_query}'\n")
print("Top 3 matching tools:")
for i, result in enumerate(test_results, 1):
    tool_name = result["tool"]["name"]
    score = result["similarity_score"]
    print(f"{i}. {tool_name} (similarity: {score:.3f})")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}
    Search query: 'I need to check the weather'

    Top 3 matching tools:
    1. get_weather (similarity: 0.560)
    2. get_forecast (similarity: 0.508)
    3. get_air_quality (similarity: 0.401)
:::
::::

::: {.cell .markdown}
## Define the tool_search Tool

Now we\'ll implement the **meta-tool** that allows Claude to discover
other tools on demand. When Claude needs a capability it doesn\'t have,
it searches for it using this `tool_search` tool, receives the tool
definitions in the result, and can use those newly discovered tools
immediately.

This is the only tool we provide to Claude initially:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="74"}
``` python
# The tool_search tool definition
TOOL_SEARCH_DEFINITION = {
    "name": "tool_search",
    "description": "Search for available tools that can help with a task. Returns tool definitions for matching tools. Use this when you need a tool but don't have it available yet.",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Natural language description of what kind of tool you need (e.g., 'weather information', 'currency conversion', 'stock prices')",
            },
            "top_k": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Number of tools to return (default: 5)",
            },
        },
        "required": ["query"],
    },
}

print("✓ Tool search definition created")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}
    ✓ Tool search definition created
:::
::::

::: {.cell .markdown}
Now let\'s implement the handler that processes `tool_search` calls from
Claude and returns discovered tools:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="75"}
``` python
def handle_tool_search(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Handle a tool_search invocation and return tool references.

    Returns a list of tool_reference content blocks for discovered tools.
    """
    # Search for relevant tools
    results = search_tools(query, top_k=top_k)

    # Create tool_reference objects instead of full definitions
    tool_references = [
        {"type": "tool_reference", "tool_name": result["tool"]["name"]} for result in results
    ]

    print(f"\n🔍 Tool search: '{query}'")
    print(f"   Found {len(tool_references)} tools:")
    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"   {i}. {result['tool']['name']} (similarity: {result['similarity_score']:.3f})")

    return tool_references


# Test the handler
test_result = handle_tool_search("stock market data", top_k=3)
print(f"\nReturned {len(test_result)} tool references:")
for ref in test_result:
    print(f"  {ref}")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}

    🔍 Tool search: 'stock market data'
       Found 3 tools:
       1. get_stock_price (similarity: 0.524)
       2. get_market_news (similarity: 0.469)
       3. calculate_compound_interest (similarity: 0.244)

    Returned 3 tool references:
      {'type': 'tool_reference', 'tool_name': 'get_stock_price'}

executions. In a real application, these would call actual APIs or
services:

``` python
def mock_tool_execution(tool_name: str, tool_input: dict[str, Any]) -> str:

## Implement Conversation Loop

Now let\'s put it all together! We\'ll create a conversation loop that
handles the complete tool search workflow.

**The conversation flow:**

1.  Claude starts with only the `tool_search` tool available
2.  When Claude calls `tool_search`, we run semantic search and return
    matching tool definitions
3.  Claude can then use the discovered tools immediately
4.  When Claude calls a discovered tool, we execute it (using mock
    responses for this demo)
5.  The loop continues until Claude has a final answer
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="77"}

## Example 1: Weather Query

Let\'s test with a simple weather question. Claude should:

1.  Call `tool_search` to find weather tools
2.  Receive weather tool definitions in the result
3.  Use one of the discovered tools
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="78"}
``` python
run_tool_search_conversation("What's the weather like in Tokyo?")
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}

    ================================================================================
    USER: What's the weather like in Tokyo?
    ================================================================================


    --- Turn 1 ---

    🔧 Tool invocation: get_weather
       Input: {
      "location": "Tokyo"
    }
       ✅ Mock result: {"location": "Tokyo", "temperature": 75, "unit": "fahrenheit", "conditions": "partly cloudy", "humidity": 61, "wind_speed": 9}

    --- Turn 2 ---

    ✓ Conversation complete

    ASSISTANT: The weather in Tokyo is currently:
    - **Temperature:** 75°F (about 24°C)
    - **Conditions:** Partly cloudy
    - **Humidity:** 61%
    - **Wind Speed:** 9 mph

    It's a pleasant day with comfortable temperatures and some cloud cover!

## Example 2: Finance Query

Let\'s try a financial calculation query that requires discovering and
using finance tools:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="79"}
``` python
run_tool_search_conversation(
    "If I invest $10,000 at 5% annual interest for 10 years with monthly compounding, how much will I have?"
)
```

::: {.output .stream .stdout}

    ================================================================================
    USER: If I invest $10,000 at 5% annual interest for 10 years with monthly compounding, how much will I have?
    ================================================================================


    --- Turn 1 ---

    🔧 Tool invocation: calculate_compound_interest
       Input: {
      "principal": 10000,
      "rate": 5,
      "years": 10,
      "frequency": "monthly"
    }
       ✅ Mock result: {"principal": 10000, "rate": 5, "years": 10, "compounding_frequency": "monthly", "final_amount": 16470.09, "interest_earned": 6470.09}

    --- Turn 2 ---

    ✓ Conversation complete

    ASSISTANT: If you invest $10,000 at 5% annual interest for 10 years with monthly compounding, you will have:

    **Final Amount: $16,470.09**

    This means you'll earn **$6,470.09** in interest over the 10-year period.

    The monthly compounding means that interest is calculated and added to your principal every month, which allows your investment to grow faster than with annual compounding due to the effect of earning "interest on interest" more frequently.

## Conclusion

In this cookbook, we implemented a client-side tool search system that
enables Claude to work with large tool libraries efficiently. We
covered:

- **Semantic tool discovery**: Using embeddings to match natural
  language queries to relevant tools, enabling Claude to find the right
  capability without seeing all available tools upfront
- **Dynamic tool loading**: Returning tool definitions in tool results
  using Claude\'s tool search feature, allowing Claude to discover and
  immediately use new tools mid-conversation
- **Context optimization**: Reducing initial context from thousands of
  tokens (19+ tool definitions) to just the single `tool_search`
  definition, cutting context usage by 90%+

### Applying This to Your Projects

Consider tool search when:

- You have **\>20 specialized tools** and context usage becomes a
  concern
- Your tool library **grows over time** and manual curation becomes
  impractical
- You need to support **domain-specific APIs** with hundreds of
  endpoints (database operations, internal microservices, third-party
  integrations)
- **Cost and latency optimization** are priorities for your application

### Next Steps

To take this implementation further:

1.  **Persist embeddings**: Cache embeddings to disk to avoid
    recomputing on every session, reducing startup time
2.  **Improve search quality**: Experiment with different embedding
    models (e.g., larger models like `all-mpnet-base-v2`) or implement
    hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching (BM25)
3.  **Scale to larger libraries**: Test with hundreds or thousands of
    tools to see how the pattern performs at production scale
4.  **Add tool metadata**: Include usage statistics, cost information,
    or reliability scores in your search ranking
5.  **Implement caching**: Cache frequently used tool definitions to
    reduce repeated searches
