# Citations

The Claude API features citation support that enables Claude to provide
detailed citations when answering questions about documents. Citations
are a valuable affordance in many LLM powered applications to help users
track and verify the sources of information in responses.

Citations are supported on:

- `claude-sonnet-4-5`
- `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`

The citations feature is an alternative to prompt-based citation
techniques. Using this featue has the following advantages:

- Prompt-based techniques often require Claude to output full quotes
  from the source document it intends to cite. This increases output
  tokens and therefore cost.
- The citation feature will not return citations pointing to documents
  or locations that were not provided as valid sources.
- While testing we found the citation feature to generate citations with
  higher recall and percision than prompt based techniques.

The documentation for citations can be found
[here](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/citations).

## Setup

First, let\'s install the required libraries and initalize our Anthropic
client.
:::

::: {.cell .code}
``` python
!pip install anthropic  --quiet
```
:::

::: {.cell .code execution_count="56"}
``` python
import json
import os

import anthropic

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "" # Put your API key here!

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

## Document Types

Citations support three different document types. The type of citation
outputted depends on the type of document being cited from:

- Plain text document citation → char location format
- PDF document citation → page location format
- Custom content document citation → content block location format

We will explore working with each of these in the examples below.
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}
### Plain Text Documents

With plain text document citations you provide your document as raw text
to the model. You can provide one or multiple documents. This text will
get automatically chunked into sentences. The model will cite these
sentences as appropriate. The model is able to cite multiple sentences
together at once in a single citation but will not cite text smaller
than a sentence.

Along with the outputted text the API response will include structured
data for all citations.

Let\'s see a complete example using a help center customer chatbot for a
made up company PetWorld.
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="57"}
``` python
# Read all help center articles and create a list of documents
articles_dir = "./data/help_center_articles"
documents = []

for filename in sorted(os.listdir(articles_dir)):
    if filename.endswith(".txt"):
        with open(os.path.join(articles_dir, filename)) as f:
            content = f.read()
            # Split into title and body
            title_line, body = content.split("\n", 1)
            title = title_line.replace("title: ", "")
            documents.append(
                {

#### Visualizing Citations

By leveraging the citation data, we can create UIs that:

1.  Show users exactly where information comes from
2.  Link directly to source documents
3.  Highlight cited text in context
4.  Build trust through transparent sourcing

Below is a simple visualization function that transforms Claude\'s
structured citations into a readable format with numbered references,
similar to academic papers.

The function takes Claude\'s response object and outputs:

- Text with numbered citation markers (e.g., \"The answer \[1\] includes
  this fact \[2\]\")
- A numbered reference list showing each cited text and its source
  document

### PDF Documents

When working with PDFs, Claude can provide citations that reference
specific page numbers, making it easy to track information sources.
Here\'s how PDF citations work:

- PDF document content is provided as base64-encoded data
- Text is automatically chunked into sentences
- Citations include page numbers (1-indexed) where the information was
  found
- The model can cite multiple sentences together in a single citation
  but won\'t cite text smaller than a sentence
- While images are processed, only text content can be cited at this
  time

Below is an example using the Constitutional AI paper to demonstrate PDF
citations:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="59"}
``` python
import base64
import json

# Read and encode the PDF
pdf_path = "data/Constitutional AI.pdf"

    Formatted response:
    ================================================================================
    Based on the paper, here are the key aspects of Constitutional AI:

    Constitutional AI is a method for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, hence the name "Constitutional AI". [1]

    The process involves two main phases:

    1. Supervised Learning Phase:
    In this phase, they sample from an initial model, generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. [2]

    2. Reinforcement Learning Phase:
    In this phase, they:
    - Sample from the finetuned model
    - Use a model to evaluate which of two samples is better
    - Train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences
    - Use "RL from AI Feedback" (RLAIF) [3]

    The key outcomes are:

    - They are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them
    - Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making
    - These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels [4]

    The ultimate goal is not to completely remove human supervision, but rather to make it more efficient, transparent and targeted. While this work reduces reliance on human supervision for harmlessness, they still relied on human supervision in the form of helpfulness labels. The researchers expect it is possible to achieve helpfulness and instruction-following without human feedback, starting from only a pretrained LM and extensive prompting, but leave this for future work. [5]

### Custom Content Documents

While plain text documents are automatically chunked into sentences,
custom content documents give you complete control over citation
granularity. This API shape allows you to:

- Define your own chunks of any size
- Control the minimum citation unit
- Optimize for documents that don\'t work well with sentence chunking

In the example below, we use the same help center articles as the plain
text example above, but instead of allowing sentence-level citations,
we\'ll treat each article as a single chunk. This demonstrates how the
choice of document type affects citation behavior and granularity. You
will notice that the `cited_text` is the entire article in contrast to a
sentence from the source article.
:::

``` python
# Read all help center articles and create a list of custom content documents
articles_dir = "./data/help_center_articles"
documents = []

for filename in sorted(os.listdir(articles_dir)):
    if filename.endswith(".txt"):
        with open(os.path.join(articles_dir, filename)) as f:
            content = f.read()

### Using the Context Field

The `context` field allows you to provide additional information about a
document that Claude can use when generating responses, but that won\'t
be cited. This is useful for:

- Providing metadata about the document (e.g., publication date, author)
- [Contextual
  retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval)
- Including usage instructions or context that shouldn\'t be directly
  cited

In the example below, we provide a loyalty program article with a
warning in the context field. Notice how Claude can use the information
in the context to inform its response but the context field content is
not available for citation.
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="61"}
``` python
import json

# Create a document with context field
document = {
    "type": "document",
    "source": {
        "type": "text",

        "data": "PetWorld offers a loyalty program where customers earn 1 point for every dollar spent. Once you accumulate 100 points, you'll receive a $5 reward that can be used on your next purchase. Points expire 12 months after they are earned.

    Let me explain PetWorld's loyalty program based on the provided information:

    PetWorld's loyalty program is straightforward - you earn 1 point for every dollar you spend. These points can be redeemed once you reach 100 points, which will get you a $5 reward that you can use on your next purchase. [1]

    Points have an expiration period of 12 months from the date they are earned. [2]

    You can easily keep track of your points by either checking your account dashboard or contacting customer service. [3]

    Please note that since this information is from an article that hasn't been updated in 12 months, some details of the program may have changed. It would be best to verify the current terms with PetWorld directly.

### PDF Highlighting

One limitation with PDF citations is only the page numbers are returned.
You can use third party libraries to match the returned cited text with
page contents to draw attention to the cited content. This cell
demonstrates PDF citation highlighting using Claude and PyMuPDF,
creating a new annotated PDF:
:::

:::: {.cell .code execution_count="62"}
``` python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

# Setup paths and read PDF
pdf_path = "data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"
output_pdf_path = "data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter-highlighted.pdf"

# Read and encode the PDF
with open(pdf_path, "rb") as f:
    pdf_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,

                    "title": "Amazon 2023 Shareholder Letter",
                    "citations": {"enabled": True},
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What was Amazon's total revenue in 2023 and how much did it grow year-over-year?",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(visualize_raw_response(response))

        for page_num in range(start_page, end_page + 1):
            page = doc[page_num]

            text_instances = page.search_for(text_to_find.strip())

            if text_instances:
                print(f"Found cited text on page {page_num + 1}")
                for inst in text_instances:
