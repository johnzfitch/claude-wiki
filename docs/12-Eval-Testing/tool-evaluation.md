    ### Task

    **Prompt**: Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 invested at 5% annual interest rate, compounded monthly for 3 years. What is the final amount in dollars (rounded to 2 decimal places)?
    **Ground Truth Response**: `11614.72`

          8.821487426757812e-05
        ]
      }
    }

    **Summary**
    I approached this compound interest calculation in the following steps:

    1. First, I identified the formula needed: P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where:
       - P = principal ($10,000)
       - r = annual interest rate (5% or 0.05)
       - n = number of times compounded per year (12 for monthly)
       - t = time in years (3)

    2. I initially tried using the calculator tool with the formula using ^ for exponentiation, but received an error.

    3. I corrected the syntax by using ** for exponentiation in Python, calculating 10000 * (1 + 0.05/12)**(12*3).

    4. The calculator returned 11614.722313334678.

    5. I attempted several approaches to round to 2 decimal places using functions like round() and int(), but these weren't available in the calculator environment.

    6. Since the calculator doesn't have built-in rounding functions, I had to manually round the result to 2 decimal places: $11,614.72.

    **Feedback**
    The calculator tool has both strengths and areas for improvement:

    1. Tool name: "calculator" is clear and descriptive, immediately conveying its purpose.

    2. Input parameters: The "expression" parameter is simple, but lacks description of what syntax is supported. It would be helpful to specify that it uses Python syntax (particularly ** for exponentiation rather than ^).

    3. Error messaging: The error messages are helpful in identifying syntax issues, but don't provide guidance on how to fix them.

    4. Functionality limitations: The calculator doesn't support common mathematical functions like round(), int(), or the math module. It would be more useful if it included basic rounding and mathematical functions.

    5. Documentation: It would be beneficial to include a brief description of supported operations and functions, along with examples of proper syntax for common calculations.

    Overall, adding better documentation and expanding the supported functions would significantly improve the usability of this tool.

        ]
      }
    }

    **Summary**
    To solve this projectile motion problem, I took the following steps:

    1. I first calculated the horizontal distance after 2 seconds:
       - Used the formula x = v₀ × cos(θ) × t
       - Since the calculator didn't accept trigonometric functions directly, I used the value 0.7071 (which is approximately cos(45°))
       - Input: 50 * 2 * 0.7071
       - Output: 70.71 meters

    2. I then calculated the vertical distance after 2 seconds:
       - Used the formula y = v₀ × sin(θ) × t - 0.5 × g × t²
       - Since sin(45°) is also approximately 0.7071
       - Input: 50 * 0.7071 * 2 - 0.5 * 9.8 * (2**2)
       - Output: 51.11 meters

    3. Finally, I calculated the total distance using the Pythagorean theorem:
       - Used the formula d = √(x² + y²)
       - Since the sqrt function wasn't available, I used the power operator with exponent 1/2
       - Input: ((70.71)**2 + (51.11)**2)**(1/2)
       - Output: 87.2475569858549 meters

    4. I rounded the result to 2 decimal places, which gives 87.25 meters.

    **Feedback**
    The calculator tool has several limitations that made this problem more complex to solve:

    1. Tool name: The name "calculator" is clear and descriptive.

    2. Input parameters: The "expression" parameter is not well-documented. There's no information about what functions or operations are supported.

    3. Description: There is no description provided for the tool, which would have been helpful to understand its capabilities and limitations.

    4. Errors encountered:
       - The calculator doesn't support common mathematical functions like cos(), sin(), sqrt(), round(), int(), or floor().
       - There's no math library implementation or prefix to use these functions.
       - There's no clear documentation on what functions are supported.

    5. Areas for improvement:
       - Add documentation about supported operations and functions
       - Implement common mathematical functions (trigonometric, rounding, square root)
       - Include examples of valid expressions
       - Provide error messages that suggest alternatives when functions aren't available
       - Support a math library like Python's math module would make the calculator much more useful for scientific calculations

    **Summary**
    N/A

    **Feedback**
    The calculator tool is useful but has some limitations:

    1. Function naming: The name "calculator" is clear and descriptive.

    2. Input parameters: The "expression" parameter is straightforward, but there's no documentation about which mathematical operations and functions are supported.

    3. Supported operations: I encountered several errors with common mathematical operations:
       - The caret symbol (^) for exponentiation didn't work; I had to use ** instead
       - Built-in functions like 'round', 'int', and 'math' modules were not available

    4. Improvement suggestions:
       - Provide documentation on which operators are supported (**, /, *, +, -, etc.)
       - Include information about available mathematical functions or implement common ones like round()
       - Add examples in the description showing proper syntax for exponentiation and other operations
       - Consider implementing a parameter for specifying decimal precision in the result

    These improvements would reduce trial and error and make the tool more efficient to use.

    **Summary**
    To calculate the population standard deviation of the dataset [12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 30, 35] rounded to 2 decimal places, I took the following steps:

    1. First, I calculated the mean of the dataset:
       - Input: (12 + 15 + 18 + 22 + 25 + 30 + 35) / 7
       - Output: 22.428571428571427

    2. Then I calculated the variance by:
       - Finding the squared deviation of each value from the mean
       - Summing these squared deviations
       - Dividing by the number of values (7) since this is a population standard deviation
       - Input: ((12-22.428571428571427)**2 + (15-22.428571428571427)**2 + (18-22.428571428571427)**2 + (22-22.428571428571427)**2 + (25-22.428571428571427)**2 + (30-22.428571428571427)**2 + (35-22.428571428571427)**2) / 7
       - Output: 57.95918367346939

    3. I then calculated the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance:
       - Input: (57.95918367346939)**0.5
       - Output: 7.61309291112813

    4. Finally, I rounded to 2 decimal places: 7.61
       (I had to determine this manually as the calculator tool didn't support rounding functions)

    **Feedback**
    The calculator tool provided basic functionality but had significant limitations:

    1. Tool name: "calculator" is clear and descriptive, indicating its purpose well.

    2. Input parameters: The "expression" parameter is straightforward, but there's no description of what types of expressions are supported or the syntax to use.

    3. Description: The tool lacks a description of its capabilities and limitations. This would have been helpful to know in advance that functions like sum(), std(), round(), int(), and math library functions are not supported.

    4. Errors encountered: Several errors occurred when trying to use common mathematical functions. The calculator doesn't support:
       - Statistical functions (std, sum)
       - Rounding functions (round)
       - Type conversion functions (int)
       - Math library functions

    5. Areas for improvement:
       - Add support for common mathematical and statistical functions like sum(), mean(), std(), round()
       - Include a library of mathematical functions like math.floor(), math.ceil()
       - Provide clear documentation on supported operations and syntax
       - Allow for variable assignment and multi-line operations to simplify complex calculations
       - Add specific statistical calculation tools for common operations like standard deviation

    These improvements would make the tool much more versatile and prevent the need for breaking down complex calculations into multiple basic arithmetic operations.

    }

    **Summary**
    I attempted to calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of 3.5 × 10^-5 M.

    Steps taken:
    1. I tried various approaches to calculate pH using the calculator tool with different logarithm function notations (log10, ln, log), but encountered errors as these functions were not defined in the calculator tool.
    2. I successfully verified the value of 3.5 × 10^-5 using the calculator tool.
    3. Since direct logarithm calculations were not working, I switched to a manual calculation approach.
    4. I used the pH formula: pH = -log10([H+])
    5. I broke down the calculation: pH = -log10(3.5 × 10^-5) = -(log10(3.5) + log10(10^-5)) = -(log10(3.5) - 5)
    6. I used the known approximation that log10(3.5) ≈ 0.544
    7. I calculated: pH ≈ -(0.544 - 5) = 4.456
    8. I rounded the result to 2 decimal places: 4.46

    The calculator tool was used multiple times with different expressions, but had limitations with logarithmic functions.

    **Feedback**
    The calculator tool has several limitations:

    1. Tool name: "calculator" is clear and descriptive, accurately representing its basic function.

    2. Input parameters: The "expression" parameter is clear but lacks documentation. There's no information about what mathematical operations or functions are supported.

    3. Function support: The calculator doesn't support essential mathematical functions like logarithms (log, log10, ln), which are critical for many scientific calculations including pH. This significantly limits its utility for chemistry-related calculations.

    4. Error messages: The error messages indicate missing functions but don't provide alternatives or guidance on what syntax is supported.

    5. Documentation: There's no documentation about what mathematical libraries or syntax the calculator uses.

    Improvement suggestions:
    - Include support for common mathematical functions (log, exp, sqrt, etc.)
    - Add clear documentation about supported operations and functions
    - Implement specialized functions for common calculations (like pH)
    - Provide more helpful error messages that suggest correct syntax
    - Include examples of supported expressions in the tool description

    These improvements would make the calculator much more useful for scientific calculations and reduce the need for manual calculations or workarounds.

          8.726119995117188e-05
        ]
      }
    }

    **Summary**
    Steps taken to complete the task:
    1. I needed to calculate the monthly mortgage payment using the standard formula: P * (r * (1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n - 1)
       Where P = principal ($200,000), r = monthly interest rate (4.5%/12), n = number of payments (360)

    2. First, I attempted to use the calculator tool with the formula using ^ for exponentiation, but received an error as Python uses ** for exponentiation.

    3. I corrected the formula using ** for exponentiation and successfully calculated the monthly payment as $1,013.3706196517716.

    4. I attempted to round to 2 decimal places using various methods (round(), int(), math.floor()), but these functions were not available in the calculator tool.

    5. Since the built-in rounding functions weren't available, I manually rounded the result to $1,013.37 based on the calculated value.

    **Prompt**: Find the larger real root of the quadratic equation 3x² - 7x + 2 = 0. Give the exact value.
    **Ground Truth Response**: `2`
    **Actual Response**: `2`
    **Correct**: ✅
    **Duration**: 16.37s
    **Tool Calls**: {
      "calculator": {
        "count": 4,
        "durations": [

          9.870529174804688e-05
        ]
      }
    }

    **Summary**
    I solved the quadratic equation 3x² - 7x + 2 = 0 using the quadratic formula:
    x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a)

    Where a = 3, b = -7, c = 2

    Steps taken:
    1. First, I attempted to use the calculator with the "sqrt" function, but encountered an error.
    2. Then I tried using the exponentiation with "^" which also caused an error.
    3. Finally, I correctly used the "**" operator for exponentiation in the calculator tool.
    4. I calculated both roots using the quadratic formula:
       - For the larger root: (-(-7) + ((-7)**2 - 4*3*2)**0.5)/(2*3) = 2.0
       - For the smaller root: (-(-7) - ((-7)**2 - 4*3*2)**0.5)/(2*3) = 0.3333333333333333

    The larger real root is 2.

    **Feedback**
    The calculator tool is useful but has some limitations and areas for improvement:

    1. Tool name: "calculator" is clear and descriptive.
    2. Input parameters: The single "expression" parameter is straightforward, though it would be helpful to have documentation on the supported syntax.
    3. Description: The tool lacks a description of what operations are supported and what syntax to use. This caused my initial errors with sqrt() and the ^ operator.
    4. Syntax limitations: The calculator doesn't support common mathematical functions like "sqrt" directly, requiring the use of exponentiation (raising to power 0.5) instead. It also uses Python-style "**" for exponentiation rather than the more common "^" symbol.
    5. Error messages: The error messages were helpful in identifying the issues with my syntax.

    Improvement suggestions:
    - Add documentation explaining the supported operations and syntax
    - Support common mathematical functions like sqrt(), sin(), cos(), etc.
    - Consider accepting multiple syntax styles for common operations like exponentiation
