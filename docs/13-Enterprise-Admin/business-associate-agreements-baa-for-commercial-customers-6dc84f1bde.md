This article is about our commercial products such as Claude for Work and the Anthropic API. For our consumer products such as Claude Free, Pro, Max and when accounts from those plans use Claude Code, see here.

 

After review of HIPAA-related compliance items and your specific use case, Anthropic may provide a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) covering our HIPAA-ready services, such as use of our first-party API or Enterprise plans.

 

For our first-party API, our BAA is only available for customers who qualify for certain HIPAA-ready services such as those subject to zero data retention agreements.

 

For clarity, the BAA does not cover Workbench and Console, Claude Free, Pro, Max, or Team plans, and other beta or chat products, features, or integrations. As part of the BAA, customers of Anthropic’s HIPAA-ready services are subject to certain configuration requirements and limitations on what features/integrations are available.

 

To learn more about Anthropic’s HIPAA-ready services or begin the BAA process, please submit an inquiry to our sales team via this form with the details of your deployment.

 

Please see our Trust Portal for more information about our compliance commitments.
