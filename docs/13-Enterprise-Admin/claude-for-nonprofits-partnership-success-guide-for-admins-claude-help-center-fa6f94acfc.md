Welcome to the Claude for Nonprofits community! This guide provides everything you need to successfully launch and scale Claude at your organization.

We've designed a flexible, self-paced approach that can be adapted to meet your organization’s needs. Move through these milestones at your own pace:

- **[Foundation](#h_0272fca3b6)** (Technical Setup and Access)

- **[Activation](#h_901104e8c7)** (First Users and Early Wins)

- **[Acceleration](#h_50539eb3f5)** (Scaling and Integration)

- **[Expansion](#h_b837947afe)** (Advanced Use Cases and Impact)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Foundation (Technical Setup and Access)

Key Resources:

- [Getting Started Guides](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12166798-getting-started-with-claude-for-enterprise) - SSO, user management, and technical configuration to guide admin through the technical set-up

- [Driving Adoption at your Organization](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/driving-enterprise-adoption-of-claude) - Course includes customizable templates for change management and adoption for your organization

### Recommendation Actions:

- Complete user management and technical configuration steps (SSO, SCIM, etc.)

- Set data retention and sharing policies

- Define success metrics using audit log data for activity tracking and consider surveys for deeper insights

- Plan your change management strategy and set success criteria

[TABLE]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activation (First Users and Early Wins)

Key Resources:

- [On-Demand AI Fluency Courses](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/)

- [Use Case and Workflow Planning](https://claude.com/resources/use-cases/workflow-improvement-planner)

### Recommendation Actions:

- Create a shared project and upload Claude documentation so all team members can reference and understand your approach (an alternative approach would be making this available on an internal intranet)

- Find 3-5 enthusiastic team members to invest in the pilot and provide early feedback. Anoint these champions as go-to experts in Slack/Teams to field questions and keep conversations active.

- Choose your first few uses cases: Start with a horizontal productivity win (fast, visible, broad impact), then quickly layer in a department-specific use case that shows what's newly possible—not just faster, but fundamentally different

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Acceleration (Scaling and Integration)

Key Resources:

- [Nonprofit Use Cases](https://claude.com/resources/use-cases/category/nonprofits)

- [How to access audit logs](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9970975-how-to-access-audit-logs)

- [Claude Artifact Inspo](https://claude.ai/artifacts?category=learn)

- [MCP Connector Directory](https://claude.com/connectors)

### Recommendation Actions: 

- Build a weekly use case spotlight schedule

- Track activity metrics using audit logs and success metrics through other collection methods such as surveys

- Identify and enable appropriate connectors and capabilities (in admin settings)

- Participate in monthly webinar series every third week of the month (email will be sent with invites to all registered admin)

[TABLE]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Expansion (Advanced Use Cases and Impact)

Key Resources:

- [Claude Train the Trainer Program](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/enterprise-train-the-trainer)

- [Case Studies Hub](https://claude.com/customers)

### Recommendation Actions: 

- Run an internal Train the trainer, our self-paced course to help build internal expertise and scale

- Identify new functions or areas of the organization that are interested in adopting Claude and determine what expansion rollout might look like

[TABLE]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your Success, Our Priority

Remember, there's no "right" timeline for implementation. Whether you're moving quickly toward organization-wide adoption or taking a measured, department-specific approach, we're here to support your journey and be your partner in this transformation!
