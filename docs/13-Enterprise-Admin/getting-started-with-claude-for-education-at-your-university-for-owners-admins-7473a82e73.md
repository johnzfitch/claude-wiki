This guide helps Admins, Owners, and Primary Owners set up and manage Claude for Education at universities. Account users can find more information in our FAQs for student, faculty, and other users.

 

 

Getting started

Before setting up your Claude for Education account, review these essential resources:

Important Considerations Before Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) and JIT/SCIM Provisioning

Setting up Single Sign-On

Setting up JIT or SCIM provisioning

Note the following information from Important Considerations Before Enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) and JIT/SCIM Provisioning:

When enforcing SSO on your Education account, there are two distinct categories to consider for existing users who are using their university email:

Users with existing Free/Pro/Team accounts who ARE added to your SSO application

These users will maintain access to their existing Free/Pro/Team accounts

They will have the ability to toggle between the Education account and their previous accounts by clicking the profile icon with their initials in the bottom left corner
​

Users with existing Free/Pro/Team accounts who are NOT added to your SSO application

If "Enforce SSO for Claude.ai" is NOT enabled: These users can still access their existing accounts using the "Continue with email" option

If "Enforce SSO for Claude.ai" IS enabled: These users will be unable to access their existing Free/Pro/Team accounts

Please note, these accounts are not deleted, but can no longer be accessed as the user is unable to login via SSO.
