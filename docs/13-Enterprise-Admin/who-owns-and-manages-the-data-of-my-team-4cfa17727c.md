Account Management

Your organization's designated Primary Owner manages your Work account and all associated data.

Primary Owners can also remove your access to the Claude for Work plan account if necessary.

 

Your organization determines which Claude services and features you can access in your Claude for Work plan account and they may choose to limit certain functionality.
