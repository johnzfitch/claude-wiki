This article provides important information about your Claude for Work account associated with your organization's Claude for Work plan (Team or Enterprise plans). It includes details about data access and control that were shared with you when your Claude for Work plan account was set up.

*This article is about our commercial products such as Claude for Work and the Anthropic API. For our consumer products such as Claude Free, Pro, Max and when accounts from those plans use Claude Code, see [here](https://privacy.claude.com/en/collections/10663362-consumers).*

## Account Management

Your organization's designated Primary Owner manages your Work account and all associated data. This includes the ability to request access to your user data through data exports, which may contain your conversations with Claude, uploaded files, and usage patterns. Primary Owners can also remove your access to the Claude for Work plan account if necessary.

Your organization determines which Claude services and features you can access in your Claude for Work plan account and they may choose to limit certain functionality.

## Governing Agreements

The use of your Claude for Work plan account is governed by the agreement between Anthropic and your organization. Please contact your Primary Owner for details of this agreement.

While Anthropic’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) describes how we collect, use, and share personal information when acting as a data controller in providing the Claude services to your organization, please note that the Anthropic [Consumer Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) do not apply to the use of the Claude for Work plan where Anthropic acts as the data processor.

## Organizational Policies

Your organization may have its own internal policies regarding usage of Claude for Work plan. Please refer to your Primary Owner for guidance.

## Questions about Privacy

If you have any questions about data privacy in your Claude for Work plan account, we encourage you to contact your organization's account owner(s).
