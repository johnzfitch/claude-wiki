Welcome to the Claude for Nonprofits community! This guide will help you get started with Claude and find ways to enhance your daily work.

Getting Acquainted to Claude

Recommendation Actions:

Log in to Claude.ai, bookmark it, and just start a chat. Consider asking Claude: "What are 5 ways you could help me in my role as [your job title]?

Create your first project for an ongoing work initiative. Link your relevant work and then begin using Claude as a thought partner!

Complete the Claude Foundations session

Begin thinking through use cases considering some of your biggest challenges as well as repetitive tasks that can be streamlined

Implementation Tips:

Ask Claude for help. If you are not sure where to start, describe your goals, role, or challenges to Claude and ask what Claude can help you with 

Save prompts that work well. When you craft a prompt that produces great results, save it to reuse and adapt for similar future tasks. You can either select the star next to the chat or maintain your own ongoing document of prompts. 

Iterate and refine. Treat your first prompt as a starting point. Ask Claude to adjust tone, length, format, or focus based on what you actually need.

 

Getting Productive with Claude 

Key Resources:

Use Case Library

Claude Artifact Inspo

MCP Connector Directory

Recommendation Actions:

Connect Claude to relevant connectors to provide seamless access to key context (Google Drive, Slack, etc.).

Connect with your administrator on monthly use case webinar opportunities provided by Anthropic.

Explore the use case library and try out one of the nonprofit use cases that is applicable to your work.

Implementation Tips:

Look at the prompts within the use case library and leverage them as a starting place. Treat it as a template to understand how to format and organize information in a prompt.

Upload relevant documents to your project so Claude understands your organization's context, past work, and priorities.

Turn on memory (go to settings>capabilities) to allow Claude to remember relevant context for chats and projects. 

 

Reach New Levels with Claude 

Key Resources:

Claude Train the Trainer Program

Case Studies Hub

Recommendation Actions:

Participate in the Train the Trainer program and receive a certificate of completion. Train the Trainer develops employees (at all levels) into confident AI champions who guide colleagues through meaningful adoption. Consider checking with your administrator for more details on building a Train the Trainer cohort within your organization!

Use Claude for a complex, multi-step project (grant narrative, program evaluation, strategic planning)

Explore Artifacts to generate editable documents, tables, or visual content

Enable code execution and file sharing (in capabilities) and create or augment either a spreadsheet or slide deck. 

Implementation Tips:

Celebrate both wins and lessons learned. Sharing what didn't work well is just as valuable as success stories—it helps everyone learn faster.

Establish quality checks. Claude is a powerful collaborator, but always review outputs for accuracy and alignment with your organization's standards.

Chain complex requests together. Break large projects into sequential prompts where each builds on the previous output—draft outline, then expand sections, then refine language.

 

Your Journey, Your Pace

There's no single "right" way to integrate Claude into your work. Some team members dive in quickly while others prefer a gradual approach. Both are valid. The goal is to find the ways Claude can genuinely support your mission-driven work—saving you time on routine tasks so you can focus more energy on the people and programs that matter most.
