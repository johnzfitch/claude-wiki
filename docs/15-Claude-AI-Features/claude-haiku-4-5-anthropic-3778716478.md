Haiku 4.5 powers sub-agents, enabling multi-agent systems that tackle complex refactors, migrations, and large feature builds with quality and speed.

### Financial analysis

Haiku 4.5 can monitor thousands of data streams at once—tracking regulatory changes, market signals, and portfolio risks in real time.

### Research sub-agents

Haiku 4.5 can tackle dozens of research sources simultaneously, from literature reviews to data synthesis, in hours instead of weeks.

## Benchmarks

Haiku 4.5 delivers strong performance and speed across coding, tool use, and reasoning tasks—matching Sonnet 4 on coding, computer use, and agentic workflows at substantially lower cost and faster speeds.

## Trust & Safety

We've conducted extensive testing and evaluation of Haiku 4.5, working with external experts to ensure it meets our standards for safety, security, and reliability. In the model card for this release, we discuss new safety results in several categories.

## Hear from our customers

> Our early testing shows that Claude Haiku 4.5 brings efficient code generation to GitHub Copilot **with comparable quality to Sonnet 4 but at faster speed**. Already we're seeing it as an excellent choice for Copilot users who value speed and responsiveness in their AI-powered development workflows.
>
> Matthew Isabel  
> Distinguished Product Manager

> Historically models have sacrificed speed and cost for quality. Claude Haiku 4.5 is blurring the lines on this trade off: **it's a fast frontier model that keeps costs efficient** and signals where this class of models is headed.
>
> Jeff Wang  
> CEO

> **Claude Haiku 4.5 delivers intelligence without sacrificing speed**, enabling us to build AI applications that utilize both deep reasoning and real-time responsiveness.
>
> Ben Lafferty  
> Staff Engineer

> Claude Haiku 4.5 is remarkably capable—**just six months ago, this level of performance would have been state-of-the-art** on our internal benchmarks. Now it runs up to 4-5 times faster than Sonnet 4.5 at a fraction of the cost, unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.
>
> Andrew Filev  
> CEO

> Claude Haiku 4.5 hit a sweet spot we didn't think was possible: **near-frontier coding quality with blazing speed and cost efficiency**. In Augment's agentic coding evaluation, it achieves 90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance, matching much larger models. We're excited to offer it to our users.
>
> Guy Gur-Ari  
> Co-Founder

> Claude Haiku 4.5 **outperformed our current models on instruction-following for slide text generation**, achieving 65% accuracy versus 44% from our premium tier model—that's a game-changer for our unit economics.
>
> Jon Noronha  
> Co-Founder, Gamma

> Speed is the new frontier for AI agents operating in feedback loops. **Haiku 4.5 proves you can have both intelligence and rapid output**. It handles complex workflows reliably, self-corrects in real-time, and maintains momentum without latency overhead. For most development tasks, it's the ideal performance balance.
>
> Brad Axen  
> Tech Lead, AI

> **Claude Haiku 4.5 is a leap forward for agentic coding**, particularly for sub-agent orchestration and computer use tasks. The responsiveness makes AI-assisted development in Warp feel instantaneous.
