The updates listed below only apply to Claude in Chrome. To view release notes for other products, refer to this article: [Release Notes](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12138966-release-notes).

## December 2025

### December 18, 2025

Claude in Chrome is now available in beta to all paid plan subscribers, including Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans.

**Claude Code integration:** Build in your terminal with Claude Code, then test and verify in the browser with the Chrome extension. Claude can read console errors, network requests, and DOM state to help debug issues directly.

**Control browser actions from Claude Desktop:** Start a task in Claude Desktop and let it handle work in the browser without switching windows.

**Record a workflow:** Teach Claude your workflow by recording the steps, and Claude learns to repeat them. Useful for repetitive browser tasks you want to delegate.

**Console logs:** Claude can now read browser console output, helping developers identify and fix errors without switching contexts.

**Admin controls for Team and Enterprise:** Admins can now manage Claude in Chrome at the organization level:

- Enable or disable the extension org-wide

- Configure allowlists and blocklists to control which sites Claude can access

- Manage Claude in Chrome in Admin settings \> Browser extension

## November 2025

### November 24, 2025

Claude in Chrome is now available in beta to all Max plan subscribers. After months of testing, we're expanding access with the following updates:

**Scheduled tasks**: Set recurring browser tasks to run automatically on your schedule. Set it once and Claude handles it from there.

**Follow a plan**: Approve Claude's plan, then let it execute the entire workflow independently within those approved boundaries, without asking for permission until it's done.

**Model selection**: Choose between Haiku 4.5 for speed, Sonnet 4.5 for complex tasks, or Opus 4.5 for maximum reasoning power—switch anytime based on what you need.

## October 2025

### October 15, 2025

**Powered by Haiku 4.5:** Claude in Chrome now defaults to Haiku 4.5 so it’s a faster, more responsive experience. You can always switch back to Sonnet 4.5.

**Claude handles image uploads for you:** Give Claude an image and tell it where to upload, whether it’s an expense report, form attachment, or a picture upload.

**Show Claude exactly what you mean:** Take a screenshot or drag to highlight specific parts of your screen. Point Claude to the exact button, field, or detail—much faster than describing complex layouts in words.

## September 2025

### September 29, 2025

The remaining Max users on our waitlist were granted access to Claude in Chrome, along with the following updates:

**Powered by Sonnet 4.5:** Claude in Chrome now defaults to Sonnet 4.5, our smartest model yet. Improved for browser tasks, you'll notice better reasoning, fewer errors, and more reliable task completion—especially for multi-step workflows.

**Work across multiple tabs:** Claude can now juggle multiple browser tabs at once. Just drag tabs into Claude's tab group and it can see and work across all of them simultaneously—no more jumping back and forth to gather information before taking action.

**Smarter on the sites you use every day:** Claude now understands how to navigate Slack, Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Docs, and GitHub without you having to direct every click. Ask Claude to "schedule a meeting" or "update the doc" and it knows what to do—no need to walk it through every step. We’re continuing to improve Claude’s understanding of other popular sites.

**Get notified when Claude needs you:** Turn on notifications and Claude will ping you when it needs your permission or when a task is complete. Now you can switch to other work while Claude handles things in the background.

**Show Claude exactly what you mean:** Upload images or take screenshots of specific screen areas to give Claude precise visual context. Much faster than describing what you're looking at.

### September 16, 2025

Claude in Chrome expanded to 10,000 Max plan users with the release of new capabilities:

**Long-running workflows:** Claude in Chrome can handle more complex, multi-step workflows, and continue working even when you switch tabs (as long as Chrome is open).

**/slash commands:** Save your best-working prompts as shortcuts (/slash commands) and reuse these proven workflows instantly without retyping instructions to Claude.

**Contextual prompt suggestions:** Claude in Chrome gives contextual prompt suggestions or helpful tips based on what website you’re on.

## August 2025

### August 26, 2025

**Claude in Chrome:** We launched Claude in Chrome to an initial cohort of 1,000 Max plan users. This experimental browser extension allows Claude to read, click, and navigate websites alongside you.
