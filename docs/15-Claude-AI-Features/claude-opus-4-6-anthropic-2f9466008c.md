## Use cases

Opus 4.6 is a premium model that works best for tasks no prior model could handle and where performance matters most. It’s built for professional software engineering, complex agentic workflows, and high-stakes enterprise tasks.

Opus 4.6 offers hybrid reasoning that allows for instant responses or extended thinking. API users have fine-grained controls for adjusting the overall effort applied to a response, balancing performance with latency and cost. Popular use cases include:

## Advanced coding

Opus 4.6 can confidently deliver production-ready code with minimal oversight. It plans carefully, runs for longer with sustained effort, and operates reliably in larger codebases. Strong code review and debugging skills means it catches its own mistakes. Senior engineers can delegate complex tasks with confidence.

## AI agents

Opus 4.6 makes agents meaningfully more useful. It handles longer, more complex task chains with fewer errors and less hand-holding, adapting its approach as conditions change. It is ideal for complex, multi-step agentic workflows where reliability and autonomy matter the most.

## Enterprise workflows

Opus 4.6 brings a level of consistency that makes AI practical for sustained, high-stakes work. It maintains context and quality across large projects and shows strong performance on everyday tasks like working with documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, running financial analyses, reading charts and diagrams, and doing research. It delivers the precision and consistency that enterprise work demands.

## Benchmarks

Claude Opus 4.6 is state-of-the-art across a wide range of coding and agentic capabilities.

Opus 4.6 demonstrates strong performance across many domains. It achieves industry-leading results with 65.4% on Terminal-Bench 2.0. It is also our best computer-using model, reaching 72.7% on OSWorld.

# Frequently asked questions

### When should I use Claude Opus 4.6?

We offer Claude models across the spectrum of speed, price, and performance. Opus 4.6 is our most capable model to date. We recommend Opus 4.6 for your most demanding use cases where you need frontier intelligence—particularly production-ready code, sophisticated AI agents, and complex document creation.

### How much does it cost to use Claude Opus 4.6?

Pricing depends on how you want to use Opus 4.6. To learn more, check out our [pricing page](https://claude.com/pricing#api).

### When should I use extended thinking?

Opus 4.6 is both a standard model and a hybrid reasoning model in one. You can pick when you want the model to answer normally and when you want it to use extended thinking.

Extended thinking mode is best for use cases where performance and accuracy matter more than latency. It significantly improves response quality for complex reasoning tasks, extended agentic work, multi-step coding projects, and deep research, and the thinking summaries help you understand key aspects of the model’s reasoning process.
