## Use cases

Sonnet 4.5 is a powerful, versatile model—built for daily use, scaled production, and complex tasks.

Sonnet 4.5 can produce near-instant responses or extended, step-by-step thinking that is made visible to the user. API users also have fine-grained control over how long the model thinks. Popular use cases include:

### Long-running agents

Sonnet 4.5 offers superior instruction following, tool selection, error correction, and advanced reasoning for customer-facing agents and complex AI workflows.

### **Code generation**

Sonnet 4.5 is a powerful choice for agentic coding, and can complete tasks across the entire software development lifecycle, from initial planning to bug fixes, maintenance to large refactors. It offers strong performance in both planning and solving for complex coding tasks, making it an ideal choice to power end-to-end software development processes.

Sonnet 4.5 supports up to 64K output tokens, which is particularly valuable for rich code generation and planning.

### **Browser and computer use**

Sonnet 4.5 excels in computer use capabilities, reliably handling any browser-based task from competitive analysis to procurement workflows to customer onboarding. Sonnet 3.5 was the first frontier AI model to be able to use computers in this way. Sonnet 4.5 uses computers even more accurately and reliably, and we expect the capability to improve over time.

### **Cybersecurity**

Teams using Sonnet 4.5 with Claude Code can deploy agents that autonomously patch vulnerabilities before exploitation, shifting from reactive detection to proactive defense.

### **Financial analysis**

Sonnet 4.5 handles everything from entry-level financial analysis to advanced predictive analysis. For example, it can continuously monitor global regulatory changes and preemptively adapt compliance systems, evolving beyond manual audit preparation to intelligent risk management.

### **Business tasks**

Sonnet 4.5 excels at producing and editing office files like slides, documents, and spreadsheets.

### **Research**

Sonnet 4.5 can search through external and internal data sources to synthesize comprehensive insights across complex information landscapes.

### **Content generation and analysis**

Sonnet 4.5 excels at writing and can understand nuance and tone to generate more compelling content and analyze content on a deeper level.

## Benchmarks

Sonnet 4.5 is our powerful and versatile model for everyday use, combining strong reasoning with efficient performance. It excels at powering agents for financial analysis, cybersecurity, and research—coordinating multiple agents and processing high volumes of data with the reliability these domains demand.

## Trust & Safety

We**’**ve conducted extensive testing and evaluation of Sonnet 4.5, working with external experts to ensure it meets our standards for safety, security, and reliability. In the model card for this release, we discuss new safety results in several categories.

We recommend Sonnet 4.5 for most AI applications where you need a balance of advanced capabilities and practical throughput—such as customer-facing agents, production coding workflows, content generation at scale, and real-time research tasks.

### How much does it cost to use Claude Sonnet 4.5

Pricing depends on how you want to use Sonnet 4.5. To learn more, check out our [pricing page](https://claude.com/pricing#api).

### When should I use extended thinking?

Sonnet 4.5 is both a standard model and a hybrid reasoning model in one: you can pick when you want the model to answer normally and when you want it to use extended thinking.

Extended thinking mode is best when performance and accuracy matter more than latency. It significantly improves response quality for complex reasoning tasks, extended agentic work, multi-step coding projects, and deep research. Thinking summaries help you understand key aspects of the model's reasoning process.
