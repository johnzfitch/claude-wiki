This feature is available to Primary Owners and Owners on Team and Enterprise plans.

Disabling the public project feature allows Team and Enterprise Owners to restrict the creation of public projects across their organization while maintaining internal sharing capabilities. Follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to [Admin settings \> Capabilities](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/capabilities).

2.  Click "Disable" next to **Public projects**.

## How does disabling public projects work?

By default, [public projects](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9519189-project-visibility-and-sharing#h_2c0e9eb7c4) are enabled for all Team and Enterprise plans. When you disable public projects:

1.  All existing public projects will be converted to private projects.

2.  Users will be prevented from creating new public projects.

**Important:** Users can still share [private projects](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9519189-project-visibility-and-sharing#h_a088ccfaa3) with individual users within your organization after disabling public projects. Any private projects that were shared with individuals will retain their shared settings.

## Impact on project sharing

Disabling public projects does not affect the internal project sharing capabilities available to Claude for Work users:

- **Individual project sharing:** Users can still share projects with specific team members using email-based invitations.

- **Organization-wide sharing:** Projects can still be shared across your entire organization (where permissions allow).

- **Permission management:** All view and edit permission levels remain available for internal sharing.

- **Collaboration features:** The "Shared with me" tab and other collaborative features will continue to function as expected.

This setting specifically controls external public sharing while preserving all internal collaboration functionality.

## Re-enabling public projects

If you choose to re-enable public projects after disabling them:

- Existing projects will remain private.

- Users will regain the ability to create new public projects.

- Internal sharing settings and permissions will remain unchanged.
