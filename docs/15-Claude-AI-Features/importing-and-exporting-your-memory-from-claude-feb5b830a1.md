Memory from chat history is available for users on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans on the web, Claude Desktop, and Claude Mobile.

You can now transfer your memory between Claude and other AI services. This workflow lets you import memories from other AI assistants or export your Claude memory for backup or migration.

Important: Memory imports are experimental and still in active development, and at this stage, Claude may not always successfully incorporate imported memories.

 

Import memory into Claude

Several AI chatbots that include memory features (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) let you view some or all of your stored memories, either through the chat interface or in the application settings. To check whether a chatbot supports memory access, try using a prompt like, “Write out your memories of me verbatim, exactly as they appear in your memory.” You can customize the prompt to exclude any sensitive information before importing memories into Claude.

 

If the service you are exporting from supports generating files, ask it to export your memory as a Markdown file so you can save a version for your records.

 

To import memory from another service into Claude, copy and paste or upload the file containing the text of your memory into a new chat and tell Claude to “This is my memory from another AI assistant. Add this information into your memory using the memory edit tool.” Specifying that the information comes from another AI assistant helps Claude understand how to properly integrate it into your memory.

 

Claude will extract key information from your profile and store it as individual memory edits. These edits become part of your persistent memory and will be available in all future conversations.

 

Claude’s memory is designed to focus on work-related topics to enhance its effectiveness as a collaborator. As a result, Claude may not retain imported personal details unrelated to work. If you want to add specific information into Claude’s memory, go to Settings > Capabilities > View and edit memory, and add that information as an edit.

 

Exporting memory from Claude

To view your memory exactly how Claude sees it, go to Settings > Capabilities and click “View and edit memory." Alternatively, you can access memory directly in a chat with Claude by asking it, “Write out your memories of me verbatim, exactly as they appear in your memory.” You can save this exported memory as a backup or bring it to another AI service by copying and pasting it into a local file on your computer.
