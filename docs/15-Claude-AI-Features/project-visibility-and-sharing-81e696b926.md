Project visibility and sharing features are available to users on Claude for Work (Team or Enterprise) plans. This article assumes that public projects are enabled for your organization. For more information, see How can I disable public projects?

Understanding the two project visibility options

When creating a project on a Team or Enterprise plan, you can choose between two initial visibility options:

Public: Everyone in your organization can view and use the project.

Private: Only invited members can view and use the project.

 

What are public projects?

If you choose to share a project with the rest of your organization upon creation, this means that any other member of your team can find it by browsing or searching the Team tab in the Projects section, and use it to start a chat. Even if a project is public, your chats within that project will be private and inaccessible to other members of your organization unless you manually share them.

 

Can I change a project from public to private?

Yes, you can switch the visibility of a project you created as public to private at any time by opening the project and clicking the “Share” button to the right of the project name:

 

 

Click “Everyone at [your organization]” under General access and select “Only people invited” to change the project from public to private:

 

 

What are private projects?

Choosing “Only people invited” keeps your project private so that you are the only user with access by default. All content within the project (chats, project knowledge, and artifacts) remains inaccessible to other members unless they are explicitly invited.

 

Can I change a project from private to public?

Adding and removing member access to private projects
To add members to a private project

Click the "Share" button to the right of the project name.

In the window that appears, add individual members from your organization using their names or email addresses.

Select the appropriate permission level:

Can view: Members can see project contents, knowledge, and instructions, and chat within the project, but cannot edit it.

Can edit: Members can modify project instructions and knowledge, update member settings, and actively contribute to the project.

This will share the project and knowledge base with the member, but your chats will remain private unless you choose to share them.

 

To remove members from a private project

A project member with "Can edit" permissions can open the project's "Share" menu.

Click on the role to the right of the member's name.

Select "Remove access."

After being removed, they will no longer be able to access this project or its content.

Adding members in bulk

You can add multiple users at once by copying and pasting a list of email addresses into the Invite by email field after clicking “Share”:

 

 

Email notifications

When someone shares a project with you, you'll receive an email notification letting you know about the new shared project and your permission level.
​

“Shared with me” tab

Projects that have been shared with you will appear in a "Shared with you" tab on your Projects section, making it easy to find and access collaborative work.

 

What happens when archiving a shared project?

When a project is archived, all sharing permissions are reset to private and previous sharing context is wiped for security.

 

Sharing and unsharing chats

Chats within a project are not shared by default.

 

To share a chat

Click the "Share" button in the upper right corner of your chat.

Click the "Share" button in the pop-up to create a shareable link.

The chat snapshot includes all messages that were sent prior to sharing the chat, including any artifacts. All messages sent after sharing a chat will remain private by default. However, you can choose to update the shared snapshot to include new messages.

 

To update a shared chat

Open the "Share" menu.

Click “Update" next to “New messages since last shared” to include any new messages in the shared snapshot.

To unshare a chat

Navigate to the "Share" menu.

Click the visibility dropdown.

Change the chat from "Shared" to "Private" to disable the direct link.
