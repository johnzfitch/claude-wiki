Artifacts are a powerful way to create content within Claude. You can take your creations further by sharing them so others can engage with and customize them. Similarly, if you see an artifact you like, you can customize it to make it your own.

This article covers how to publish artifacts publicly, share them within your organization, and discover artifacts created by others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Publishing vs. Sharing

Claude uses different terms depending on your plan:

- **Publishing** (free, Pro, Max): Makes your artifact publicly available. Anyone with the link can view and interact with it.

- **Sharing** (Team, Enterprise): Makes your artifact available within your organization only. Viewers must be logged into your Team or Enterprise account to access it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discovering artifacts

Discovering and browsing artifacts is available on free, Pro, and Max plans on web, Claude for iOS and Android, and Claude Desktop.

Access a curated collection of artifacts directly from the artifacts space in your Claude sidebar by clicking [Artifacts \> Inspiration](http://claude.ai/artifacts) (or the "Get inspired" banner on mobile).

The Inspiration tab features:

- High-quality, useful artifacts across various categories

- Examples to inspire your own creations

- One-click access to try any artifact immediately

- Easy customization of existing artifacts to make them your own

Artifacts are organized into categories such as Learn something, Life hacks, Play a game, Be creative, and Touch grass.

**For Team and Enterprise users:** You can discover and browse artifacts shared within your organization, but you won't see the public Inspiration tab. Instead, you'll find work-focused artifacts shared by colleagues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Publishing artifacts

Publishing is available on free, Pro, and Max plans.

**To publish an artifact:**

1.  Navigate to the artifact you want to publish.

2.  Ensure you're on the correct artifact version.

3.  Click the “Publish” button.

4.  Copy the public link to share with others.

### Who can access published artifacts

**Non-users:**

- View and interact with any published artifact without signing up.

- Try all basic functionality without a Claude account.

- Prompted to sign up only for advanced features like customizing or using AI-powered capabilities.

**Claude users (free, Pro, Max):**

- Full access to view, interact with, and customize any published artifact.

- Can use AI-powered features within their usage limits.

- Can save and organize artifacts they discover.

### Embedding artifacts

After publishing, you'll see a “Get embed code” button.

Click it to open a modal with automatically generated code you can copy and paste to embed your artifact on another website.

[](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1951685860/6bf1aa2c57d6ff95804797779e9c/image.png?expires=1770722100&signature=179b7d4622d86efd1a541c8647ea9507ed38985bb9f07932fc27bc1e8f657c0a&req=dSkiF892mIlZWfMW1HO4zcqH4NmEy4Zsf3CUbx4Ru6VV6c7YDxpNc%2Fjiel9o%0A5W4gTA4FiQr8LPjeJs4%3D%0A)

You must specify which websites can embed your artifact by entering URLs in the **Allowed domains** field, separated by commas.

### Unpublishing artifacts

After publishing an artifact, an “Unpublish” button appears, giving you the option to revoke access.

**Important:** Once you unpublish an artifact, you cannot publish that same artifact again. You'll need to create a new artifact if you want to publish it later. Unpublishing also permanently deletes all associated storage data (both personal and shared) if the artifact used persistent storage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sharing artifacts within your organization

Internal sharing is available on Team and Enterprise plans.

Artifacts created on Team or Enterprise accounts can only be shared within your organization—they cannot be published publicly.

**To share an artifact:**

1.  Navigate to the artifact you want to share.

2.  Ensure you're on the correct artifact version.

3.  Click the “Share” button.

4.  Click “Share & copy link” to make this version shareable.

### Who can access shared artifacts

- Only members of your Team or Enterprise organization.

- Viewers must authenticate with their Team or Enterprise account.

- If the artifact was created from a project, viewers must also have access to that project.

### Sharing artifacts with attachments

When you share an artifact, viewers also gain access to any attachments and files in the conversation that created it. Consider this before sharing artifacts from conversations containing sensitive documents.

### Unsharing artifacts

**To unshare an artifact:**

1.  Click the “Share” button in the upper right corner of the artifact.

2.  In the **Artifact shared** modal, click “Unshare.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Customizing artifacts

Customizing is available on all plans: free, Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise.

Customizing allows you to build upon and modify artifacts created by others:

1.  When viewing an artifact, look for the "Customize" button.

2.  Click the button to start a new Claude conversation with the artifact's content.

3.  You'll be redirected to Claude, where you can modify and interact with the artifact.

### What happens when you customize

- A new conversation is created for you with Claude

- The original artifact's content is added to your conversation

- You can modify, expand upon, or use the artifact as inspiration

- Your changes don't affect the original—you're working on your own copy

**Note:** If you haven't used artifacts before, clicking "Customize" will automatically enable the feature for your account. If you don't have a Claude account, you'll be prompted to sign up.
