Please Note: Our response times are currently longer than normal due to our recent launch and an increase in email volume. We will reply to your appeal/email as soon as we can and we ask for your patience in the meantime.

Repeated Violations of Our Usage Policy

Account Creation from an Unsupported Location

Terms of Service Violations

 

If you feel your account has been wrongly suspended or terminated, please fill out the appeal form linked below with your account information so our Safeguards team can further investigate why your account was disabled.

Warnings

 

As part of our safety process, we warn users if we believe their prompts are violating our Usage Policy. For API customers, these warnings are linked to ongoing thresholds of violative behavior across their entire API account.

 

If you believe we’ve made a mistake in issuing you a warning, please email usersafety@anthropic.com with the details of your situation and your account information.
