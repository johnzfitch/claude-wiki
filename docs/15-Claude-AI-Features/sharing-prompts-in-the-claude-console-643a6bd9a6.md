The prompt sharing feature enables teams to collaborate on prompt development within the Claude Console. This feature allows workspace members to share, edit, and iterate on prompts together, maintaining a clear revision history attributed to the specific contributors.

 

Sharing a Prompt

Create a prompt in the Workbench within your desired workspace.

Click on the prompt title at the top of the page.

Select "Share" from the dropdown menu:

 

 

Change the access settings from "Private" to "Shared."

Click the "Copy link" button that appears:

 

 

Share the link with members of your workspace.

Note: Shared prompts can be viewed and edited by any workspace member with the direct link.

 

Collaborating on Shared Prompts
Editing

When working on a shared prompt:

Any workspace member can make edits to the prompt.

Each edit is saved as a new revision.

Authorship is tracked for each revision.

All revisions remain accessible through the version history.

Note: If a collaborator saves changes to the prompt while you are viewing it, you will be prompted with a message to “Go to the Latest Version,” where all their changes will be reflected.

 

 

Viewing Version History

To see previous versions of a prompt:

Click on the prompt title.

Select "Version history" from the dropdown:

 

 

Choose the specific version you want to view from the list.

Note: Past versions cannot be edited. To restore the prompt to a previous version, select the version from the version history list, and click the “Restore” button in the pop up.

 

 

Unsharing a Prompt

Click on the prompt title at the top of the page.

Select "Share" from the dropdown menu.

Change the access settings from "Shared" to "Private":

Note: Unsharing immediately disables access via the direct link. Anyone that the link was previously shared with will no longer be able to view the prompt.
