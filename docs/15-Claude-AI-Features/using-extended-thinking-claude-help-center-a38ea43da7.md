Extended thinking mode allows Claude (Claude 4 models and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to spend more time breaking down problems, planning solutions, and exploring different approaches before responding. This article explains how to use this feature and when it's most beneficial.

## How to use extended thinking mode

### Enabling extended thinking

1.  Click the model selector in the chat interface.

2.  Ensure you have selected a Claude 4 model from the dropdown.

3.  Click the “Search and tools” button on the lower left of your chat interface.

4.  Switch the "Extended thinking" toggle on.

**Note:** If you’ve started chatting without extended thinking, toggling this on will start a new chat (and vice versa).

### Viewing Claude's thought process

When extended thinking is enabled, you'll see:

- A "Thinking" indicator with a timer showing how long Claude has been processing.

- An expandable "Thinking" section above Claude's response.

- Click the "Thinking" section to view Claude's thought process summary and problem-solving approach.

### Switching back to normal mode

1.  Click the “Search and tools” button on the lower left of your chat interface.

2.  Switch the "Extended thinking" toggle on.

### Incomplete thought processes

Occasionally, you may notice that Claude's thinking stops before it's complete, with a message stating that the rest of Claude's thought process is not available.

This happens when Claude's thinking involves information our safety systems have identified as potentially posing an elevated risk of harm or misuse per our [Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).

If the incomplete thought process affects Claude's ability to help with your request, you can try reframing your prompt to help Claude approach the problem from a different angle.

## When to use extended thinking

Extended thinking mode is particularly valuable for:

### Complex problem-solving

- Mathematical calculations and proofs

- Physics problems

- Competition-level coding challenges

- In-depth analysis of complex topics

### Detailed planning and analysis

- Comprehensive project planning

- Detailed document analysis

- Multi-step technical problems

- Other complex questions

## When to chat without extended thinking

- Simple questions and everyday conversations

- Basic information requests

- General writing tasks

## Tips for using extended thinking mode

1.  **Be specific**: Clearly state your problem or question to help Claude focus its extended thinking time effectively

2.  **Review the thought process**: Expand the thinking section to understand how Claude arrived at its conclusion, which can be valuable for learning and verification

3.  **Consider time trade-offs**: While extended thinking can provide more thorough responses, it takes longer. Choose this mode when the additional analysis time will truly benefit your task
