Incognito chats are available to all Claude users (free, Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans).

## What are incognito chats?

Incognito chats are temporary conversations that aren't saved to your chat history or to [Claude’s memory](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11817273-using-claude-s-chat-search-and-memory-to-build-on-previous-context). These differ from regular chats in several ways:

- Incognito chats are not used for training. See our Privacy Center for more information:

  - [Is my data used for model training?](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/10023580-is-my-data-used-for-model-training) (for free, Pro, and Max plans)

  - [Is my data used for model training?](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996868-is-my-data-used-for-model-training) (for Team and Enterprise plans)

- While incognito chats are retained according to your existing data retention policies (30 days for safety, longer if flagged), they are not saved to your chat history.

- Claude won’t pull information from incognito chats when searching previous conversations.

- If you are using Claude’s memory:

  - Starting an incognito chat won’t use Claude’s existing memory.

  - Incognito chats will not be included in future memory summaries.

## How to start an incognito chat

When starting a new chat with Claude outside of a project, you'll see a ghost icon in the upper right corner of your screen:

1.  Click the ghost icon to enable incognito mode.

2.  The interface will indicate you're in an incognito chat with a black border and “Incognito chat” label in the upper left corner.

3.  Begin your conversation with Claude.

4.  When you’re finished chatting, click the “x” in the upper right corner to close the incognito chat.

## Important information for Team and Enterprise plans

If you're using incognito chats on a Team or Enterprise plan:

- Incognito chats are still included in organizational data exports available to account Owners.

- While incognito chats aren’t saved to your chat history, they are retained for 30 days for safety, or longer in accordance with your organization's data retention policy.

## FAQ

### Can Claude access my profile information (custom styles, personal preferences, etc.) in incognito chats?

Yes, Claude can access this information within an incognito chat.

### Can I convert an incognito chat to a regular chat?

No, once you start an incognito chat, it cannot be converted to a regular chat or saved to your history.

### Can I use incognito mode in projects?

Incognito mode is currently only available for chats outside of projects, so you will not see the ghost icon when starting a chat within a project.

### What happens if I accidentally close an incognito chat?

Once closed, incognito chats cannot be reopened. Make sure to save any important information before ending your session.
