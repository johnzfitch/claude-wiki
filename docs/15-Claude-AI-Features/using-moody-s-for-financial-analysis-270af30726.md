Credit Analysis for Portfolio Management

Example input prompt:

Analyze the credit profile of XYZ Corporation. What’s their current 
rating, what factors could trigger a downgrade, and are there any recent 
research reports I should review?

For this analysis, Claude might use the following workflow:

Entity Discovery: Use findEntity to locate XYZ Corporation and retrieve its unique Moody’s entity ID.

Rating Retrieval: Call getEntityRatings to retrieve the current credit rating, outlook, and rating date.

Risk Factor Analysis: Execute getEntityRatingDrivers to identify the key factors that could lead to rating upgrades or downgrades.

Rating Methodology: Use getEntityScorecard to view the detailed scorecard showing how Moody’s evaluates this entity across different factors.

Research Review: Call searchEntityDocuments to find recent research reports, sector analyses, or rating action commentaries.

Claude might then provide a comprehensive credit analysis including the current rating, key risk factors to monitor, and relevant insights from Moody’s research.

 

M&A Due Diligence

Example input prompt:

We’re evaluating an acquisition of ABC Manufacturing. What’s their credit 
standing, and how does it compare to their sector peers? Include relevant 
research on industry trends.

To complete this request, Claude might follow this workflow:

Target Analysis: Use findEntity and getEntityRatings to establish the target’s creditworthiness.

Rating Factors: Call getEntityScorecard and getEntityRatingDrivers to understand the underlying credit fundamentals and potential risks.

Sector Context: Execute searchEntityDocuments with sector-specific queries to find research on industry trends, peer comparisons, and market outlook.

Synthesis: Combine ratings, scorecard metrics, and research insights to provide a comprehensive view of the target’s credit profile and sector positioning.

Claude would then respond with a due diligence summary including credit ratings, key risk factors, sector positioning, and relevant research findings.

 

Investment Portfolio Monitoring

Example input prompt:

Monitor my portfolio holdings for any rating changes or negative rating 
drivers. My holdings include: Company A, Company B, and Company C.

For this task, Claude might use the following approach:

Entity Identification: Use findEntity to locate each portfolio company in Moody’s database.

Rating Status: Call getEntityRatings for each holding to check current ratings and outlooks.

Risk Assessment: Execute getEntityRatingDrivers for holdings with negative outlooks or recent rating changes to identify specific risk factors.

Research Updates: Use searchEntityDocuments to find any recent research publications or rating action commentaries for companies showing credit stress.

Claude might then respond with a portfolio monitoring report highlighting any rating changes, companies on negative watch, and key risk factors requiring attention.

 

Counterparty Risk Assessment

Example input prompt:

We’re entering a large trade with DEF Bank. Assess their credit quality 
and identify any factors that could impact their creditworthiness over the 
next 12 months.

For this assessment, Claude might follow these steps:

Entity Lookup: Use findEntity to locate DEF Bank in Moody’s coverage universe.

Credit Profile: Call getEntityRatings to retrieve current ratings and outlook.

Rating Analysis: Execute getEntityScorecard to review the bank’s financial strength across key metrics like capital adequacy, asset quality, and liquidity.

Forward-Looking Factors: Use getEntityRatingDrivers to identify specific factors that could trigger rating changes.

Research Context: Call searchEntityDocuments to find sector research on banking industry trends and systemic risks.

Claude would then provide a counterparty risk assessment including current credit standing, key vulnerabilities, and forward-looking risk factors.

 

Tips for Using Moody’s

Be specific about entities: When searching for entities, include relevant identifiers like ticker symbols, full legal names, or location information for more accurate results.

Example: Instead of “Apple”, try “Apple Inc. (AAPL)”

Leverage rating drivers for forward-looking analysis: The rating upgrade/downgrade factors provide valuable insights into what could change an entity’s credit profile.

Example: “What factors would lead to a downgrade of Company X’s rating?”

Combine tools for comprehensive analysis: Use multiple tools together to build complete credit profiles. Start with ratings, then examine scorecards and drivers, and supplement with research.

Access is governed by your Moody’s subscription: Claude can only access data and research that your Moody’s account has permission to view. The connector respects your subscription entitlements.

Use research search for sector insights: The document search isn’t limited to individual entities. Search by sector, theme, or risk type to find broader market analysis.

Example: “Find Moody’s research on renewable energy sector credit trends”

Rating scorecards provide methodology transparency: Review scorecards to understand how Moody’s weighs different factors in their rating assessment, which can inform your own credit analysis framework.
