Quick entry is a redesigned experience for Claude Desktop on Mac that lets you access Claude instantly from anywhere on your computer. With quick entry, you can start chats, capture screenshots, share application windows, and use voice dictation to interact with Claude without navigating away from your current task.

Quick entry is available to all Claude users (free, Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans) using Claude Desktop on macOS.

Key features

Quick entry includes three main capabilities:

Instant access: Double-tap the Option key to open Claude from any app.

Visual context: Capture screenshots or click application windows to share what you're working on.

Voice input: Press Caps Lock to dictate your message to Claude with real-time transcription.

 

System requirements

To use quick entry, you need:

macOS 12 or later for quick entry features

Click "Continue."
