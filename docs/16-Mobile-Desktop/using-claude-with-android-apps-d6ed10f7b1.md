Claude can now connect with your Android device's system apps to help you take action directly from your conversations. When you chat with Claude, it can draft messages, emails, calendar events, set alarms and timers, find locations, and more — all through your everyday apps without copy-paste.

This feature is supported on all Claude plans and works with your device's native and third-party apps, including messaging, email, calendar, alarms, timers, location services, maps, and Health Connect (in beta on Pro and Max plans only).

 

What can Claude do with Android apps?

Claude can help you:

Draft and send messages through your default messaging app or third-party apps (e.g. WhatsApp, Slack, Messenger).

Compose emails that open directly in your Android device's email app with content pre-filled.

Access your location to provide contextual suggestions for nearby places and services.

Display locations on maps and help you navigate to restaurants, stores, and other destinations.

Read and manage your calendar to check availability, create events, and schedule meetings.

Set alarms directly through your Clock app.

Set timers directly for cooking, workouts, or any activity.

Read and analyze your health data through Health Connect to help you understand fitness patterns, track progress toward goals, and visualize trends with native charts.

Limitations

Location: Members of Team or Enterprise plans can’t access the location tool at this time.

Calendar: Ability to edit events depends on your ownership of the event.

Reminders: These are exclusively available on Claude for iOS, so Claude can’t create and manage reminders on Android.

Contacts: Claude does not have direct access to your contacts.

Health: Available on Pro and Max plans only. Requires Android 14 or later and Health Connect. Currently limited to users in the US. Claude can read health data but cannot write or modify entries in Health Connect.

 

 

How Claude helps you take action

When Claude determines that using one of these features would be helpful, it will automatically offer to help. You'll see a card or prompt within your conversation that lets you review and take action with Claude’s help.

Note: Setting alarms and timers works with voice mode beta. Other features like drafting messages and calendar events are not supported when using voice mode. See Using voice mode on Claude Mobile Apps for more information.

Sending texts and emails with Messages and Mail

Ask Claude to help draft a message or email (for example: "Draft an email to my supervisor about the project update").

Claude will prepare the content and show you a preview.

Tap the message card to open your messaging or email app.

Review the pre-filled content and make any changes if needed.

Send the message as you normally would.

Example: "Draft a message to my study group about canceling tonight's session."

 

Using location for contextual suggestions

Ask Claude for location-based recommendations (for example: "What restaurants are near me?").

Claude will request access to your location if not already granted.

Based on your location, Claude provides relevant suggestions.

You can view locations on a map and get navigation directions.

Example: "Find nearby parks for jogging."

 

Displaying locations with Maps

When Claude suggests locations, they can be displayed on an interactive map.

Tap on any location to see more details.

Select a location to open it in Google Maps for navigation.

Get turn-by-turn directions directly from the map.

Example: "Show me hardware stores within five miles on a map."

 

Managing your calendar

Ask Claude to check your schedule or create events.

Claude will request calendar access if not already granted.

For checking availability: Claude reads your calendar and identifies free slots.

For creating events: Claude prepares event details and adds them to your calendar.

You can edit or delete events as needed.

Examples:

"What meetings do I have tomorrow?"

"Schedule a team lunch for next Thursday at noon."

"Create a recurring workout session every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 AM."

Setting alarms and timers using Clock apps

Ask Claude to set an alarm or timer.

Claude will automatically create the alarm or start the timer.

Your device's Clock app will handle the alarm or timer.

You'll receive notifications as normal when the alarm goes off or timer ends.

Examples:

"Set an alarm for 7 AM tomorrow."

"Start a 20-minute timer for my workout."

 

 

Accessing and analyzing your health data

Note: Health features are available in beta on Pro and Max plans only, require Android 14 or later, and are limited to users in the US.

Claude can read your health and fitness data from Health Connect to help you understand patterns, track progress, and make informed decisions about your wellbeing. When you ask Claude about your health data, it can display insights using native charts that feel integrated with Android.

Important: We are not a medical device and cannot provide medical guidance. Always consult a licensed professional.

What is Health Connect?

Health Connect is Android's centralized platform for health and fitness data. It aggregates information from various fitness apps and wearables (like Fitbit, Samsung Health, and Google Fit) into a single, secure location. Claude accesses your health data through Health Connect, which means it can see data from any app you've connected to Health Connect.

 

If you haven't set up Health Connect yet, you can find it in your device settings or download it from the Google Play Store.

 

What health data can Claude access?

With your permission, Claude can read the following types of data from Health Connect:

Activity metrics: Steps, distance, floors climbed, active calories, and exercise duration

Workouts: Type (running, cycling, strength training, etc.), duration, distance, heart rate data, and calories burned

Vitals: Heart rate, resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen

Body measurements: Weight, height, body mass index, and body fat percentage

Sleep: Total sleep time, sleep stages, and time in bed

Nutrition: Calories consumed, macronutrients, hydration, and micronutrients (if tracked)

Note: Our memory feature is designed to prevent Claude from using sensitive health information in future conversations.

How to use health features

Ask Claude a question about your health or fitness data (for example: "How active have I been this week?" or "Show me my sleep trends").

Claude will request access to your health data through Health Connect if not already granted.

Review the permission prompt and select the data types you want to share.

Claude analyzes your data and provides insights, often with visual charts to help you understand trends.

Example prompts

"Help me understand my workout patterns over the past month."

"I've been sleeping poorly—can you analyze my sleep data and look for patterns?"

"Show me how my daily step count compares week over week."

"What's my average resting heart rate, and how has it changed recently?"

"Create a summary of my fitness activity for the past 30 days."

Understanding health visualizations

Claude displays health insights using native Android charts that appear directly in your conversation. These charts can show:

Bar charts for comparing activity across days or weeks

Line charts for tracking trends over time (pace, heart rate, weight)

Progress indicators for goals and milestones

Tap on chart elements to see more details about specific data points.

 

Usage guidelines for optimal results

Be specific about what type of action you want Claude to take and include all relevant details like recipients, dates, times, and durations in your request. For alarms, specify AM/PM and any recurring days you need. For timers, mention what the timer is for to help with labeling. Always review content in the destination app before sending or saving.

 

 

What data can Claude access?

Claude only accesses the data necessary for each specific request:

Location: Current location only when relevant to your request.

Calendar: Event details to check availability and create/modify events.

Messages/Email: Claude does not read existing messages or emails, only creates new content.

Alarms and timers: Created directly without accessing personal data.

Health: Activity, workout, vital signs, body measurements, sleep, and nutrition data from Health Connect — only when you ask a question that requires this information and have granted permission.

Claude's connection to your Android apps works through your device's standard sharing system and intent system—the same secure methods used by all Android apps.

 

Do I need to grant permissions to Claude for Android?

Permission requirements vary by feature:

Messages and Email: No permissions required (uses Android's sharing system).

Calendar Events: Claude needs your permission to read your calendar and view events, but can write to your calendar or draft calendar events using just the system UI (no permissions required).

Location and Maps: Permission required when Claude needs to access your location.

Alarms and Timers: Uses your device's standard alarm and timer functions.

Health Connect: Permission required. Claude will request access to specific health data categories when needed.

For features requiring permissions (like location or calendar access), Claude will request permission contextually with clear explanations of why the access is needed. You’ll be prompted to approve the action with three options: Allow once, Always allow, or Don't allow.

 

 

These permissions can be managed at any time in your device settings by going to Settings > Apps > Claude > Permissions. Click into each permission listed under Allowed and Not allowed to make changes. You can toggle between “Allow only while using the app” or “Ask every time” to change Claude’s access, or remove permissions by choosing “Don’t allow.” Claude will only request permissions if needed for specific features, and you can always choose to decline while still using other capabilities.

 

Health Connect permissions are managed separately from other app permissions. When Claude requests health access, you'll see the Health Connect permissions screen where you can choose exactly which data types to share. You can modify these permissions at any time by going to Settings > Apps > Health Connect > App permissions > Claude.

 

 

Troubleshooting
Claude isn't offering to use my apps

Make sure you're using the latest version of Claude for Android. See How to update Claude for Android for instructions.

Try being more specific about wanting to send a message, create an event, or set a timer (see examples above).

Restart Claude for Android and try again.

Permission prompts don't appear

Check that the app for which Claude needs permissions is installed and set up on your phone.

Navigate to Settings > Apps > Claude to verify that Claude for Android has the required permissions.

Ensure your Android OS is up to date.

Sharing options don't appear for messages or emails

Check that you have messaging and email apps installed and set up.

Try clearing the Claude for Android cache in your device settings:

Navigate to your app settings and select "Claude" from the list.

Select "Storage & cache."

Tap "Clear cache."

Calendar events aren't opening correctly

Verify you have a calendar app installed.

Check that your preferred calendar app is set as the default for calendar events.

Make sure the calendar app you’re trying to use is up to date.

Alarms or timers aren't being created

Ensure your device's Clock app is enabled and up to date.

Check that "Do Not Disturb" settings aren't preventing alarms. 

Content appears different than expected

Your Android mobile apps may format content slightly differently than Claude.

You can always edit the content in the destination app before sending or saving.

Some features may vary depending on your specific Android version and device manufacturer.

Health data isn't appearing or seems incomplete

Verify that you have a Pro or Max plan and are located in the US.

Ensure you're running Android 14 or later.

Check that Health Connect is installed and that your fitness apps are connected to it.

Verify that you've granted Claude access to the relevant health data types in Settings > Apps > Health Connect > App permissions > Claude.

If you recently started using Health Connect, there may not be enough historical data for trend analysis.

Some data types require a compatible wearable device (like a Fitbit or Samsung Galaxy Watch).

Health Connect isn’t supported when using work profiles on Android devices.
