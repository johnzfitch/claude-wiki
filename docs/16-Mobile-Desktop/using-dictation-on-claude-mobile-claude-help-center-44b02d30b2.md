Dictation is currently available for users on free, Pro, and Team plans

Dictation allows you to speak your prompts instead of typing them when using Claude for iOS or Android.

## Getting started

1.  Open Claude for iOS or Android.

2.  Start a new chat with Claude.

3.  Tap the microphone icon on the right side of the chat input field.

    - If this is your first time using dictation, you'll need to select your preferred language. You can change this later in Settings.

4.  Dictate your prompt.

5.  Tap the arrow icon to send your prompt.

    - To cancel without sending, tap the "X" icon.

Your prompt will automatically appear as text in the chat window. Claude will respond to your prompt in text format.

## Supported languages

Dictation is currently available in these languages:

- English

- French

- German

## Changing your language settings

To change your speech input language:

1.  Tap your initials in the upper right corner.

2.  Select “Speech Input Language.”

3.  Choose your preferred language from the dropdown.

## Data privacy

After converting your speech input to text, we will delete your audio recording. We will not retain a copy of your speech input or use it for training our generative models.
