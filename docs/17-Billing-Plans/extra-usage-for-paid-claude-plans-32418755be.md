This article explains how to enable and use extra usage on your paid Claude plan (Pro, Max 5x, or Max 20x), allowing you to continue working with Claude after reaching your plan’s usage limits by switching to pay-as-you-go pricing.

 

What is extra usage?

Extra usage allows individuals subscribed to paid Claude plans (Pro, Max 5x, and Max 20x) to continue using Claude seamlessly after reaching their included usage limits. Instead of being blocked when you hit your session limits, you can switch to consumption-based pricing at standard API rates and continue your work without interruption.

Note: If you subscribed through one of the Claude mobile apps, you can only enable extra usage on the web version of Claude. You will need to add your payment method before enabling and purchasing extra usage on the web.

 

 

How extra usage works

When you reach your plan’s usage limit with extra usage enabled:

You’ll see a notification that you’ve reached your session usage limit.

If extra usage is enabled and you have funds available, you can choose to continue working.

Your subsequent usage will be billed at standard API pricing rates.

Your session limits reset every five hours as usual.

Note: Extra usage is charged separately from your paid Claude subscription and appears as additional charges on your bill.

 

 

Enabling extra usage

To enable extra usage on your paid Claude plan:

Navigate to Settings > Usage in your Claude account.

Locate the Extra usage section.

Click "Enable" to turn on extra usage.

Set up your payment method if not already configured.

Configure your spending preferences.

Click “Adjust limit” to control costs with a monthly spending cap. You can also select “Set to unlimited” if you prefer no spending restrictions:

 

 

You’ll then need to prepay to cover usage beyond your plan limits. Click “Add funds,” enter the amount you want to purchase in the modal, then click “Purchase.”

You can also enable auto-reload to automatically make a purchase when your balance falls below a threshold you set:

 

Note: There is a daily redemption limit of $2000.

 

 

Setting spending controls

Control your extra usage spending with:

Monthly spending cap: Set a maximum amount you're willing to spend on extra usage each month.

Auto-reload settings: Automatically purchase credits when your balance drops below a threshold.

Usage alerts: Receive notifications when approaching your spending limits.

 

 

Extra usage pricing

Extra usage is billed at standard API rates; see our pricing page for details.

 

 

Managing your extra usage
Monitoring usage and costs

Track your extra usage through:

Usage dashboard: View real-time consumption in Settings > Usage.

Current spending: Monitor your month-to-date extra usage costs.

Usage history: Review past consumption patterns to optimize future usage.

Tips for cost-effective usage

To manage extra usage costs while maintaining productivity:

Choose efficient models: Use our most efficient model - Haiku 4.5, or Sonnet 4.5 for most tasks. These provide excellent performance at lower token costs than Opus models.

Leverage your included usage first: Plan intensive work sessions around your five-hour usage windows.

Start new conversations: Begin fresh chats for new topics to minimize the size of your context window.

Use projects effectively: Store frequently referenced documents in project knowledge instead of re-uploading.

Set appropriate limits: Start with conservative spending caps and adjust based on your needs.

 

 

How extra usage works with other features
Claude Code

Extra usage applies to both Claude conversations and Claude Code terminal usage. Your combined usage across both interfaces counts toward your limits.

 

Research mode

When using Research mode, extra usage rates apply once you exceed your included Max 20X limits. Research sessions may consume tokens more quickly due to multiple searches and comprehensive analysis.

 

Projects and files

Documents stored in project files count toward your context when used in conversations. Extra usage pricing applies to all tokens processed, including project content.

 

 

Frequently Asked Questions
Can I disable extra usage after enabling it?

Yes, you can disable extra usage at any time through Settings > Usage. Once disabled, you'll only have access to your plan's included usage.

 

How quickly do my regular usage limits reset?

Your plan’s included usage limit will reset every five hours once you reach it. Extra usage doesn’t affect this reset timing.

 

I subscribed to a paid Claude plan on the App or Play store; how can I access extra usage?

If you purchased your paid plan through one of the Claude mobile apps, extra usage is only available if you enable and purchase it on the Claude web app. You will not be able to set up extra usage on the mobile app.

 

Is extra usage available for all paid plan tiers?

Yes, extra usage is now available for all paid Claude plans, including Pro, Max 5x, and Max 20x plans.

 

Can I track extra usage separately from my included usage?

Yes, the usage dashboard clearly distinguishes between your included plan usage limits and any extra usage consumption.

 

Will I get a warning before switching to extra usage?

Yes, you’ll see a clear notification when approaching and reaching your included usage limits, with a confirmation that you’ll continue with extra usage.

 

Why was I able to exceed my extra usage limit?

It's possible to slightly exceed your defined usage limit. Our system checks if you're within your limit before you're allowed to make a single request or send a message. Once the request is processed, we calculate your token consumption, which means you may bypass your limit with that request. Once this happens, any subsequent requests will be blocked.

 

Does extra usage pricing differ from API pricing?

No, extra usage is billed at the same standard API rates shown in the pricing table above.
