How your Enterprise plan is billed depends on when and how you purchased it. This article covers pricing and billing mechanics.

 

Usage-based Enterprise plans

Usage-based Enterprise plans charge a base seat fee plus actual usage costs drawn from a shared organizational pool.

 

There are two seat types: Chat and Chat + Claude Code. For details on what each seat type includes, see Purchasing and managing seats on Enterprise plans.

 

How usage-based billing works

All usage across your organization draws from a shared token pool:

Pooled usage: All users share one organizational token pool rather than individual allocations.

No waste: Tokens can be used by any team member, eliminating unused individual allocations.

Consumption-based billing: Costs scale with actual consumption at API pricing rates.

Spend controls: Admins can set spending caps at the organization, seat tier, and individual user levels.

Usage is billed monthly in arrears based on actual consumption during the billing period.

 

Usage Token Pricing

Usage is billed at standard API rates; see our pricing page for details.

 

Adding seats mid-term

When you add seats during your billing term, new seats are prorated for the remainder of your annual term. You'll receive an invoice immediately.

 

Example: If you start with 100 Chat seats on January 1 and on March 1 you add 10 more Chat seats and purchase 5 Chat + Claude Code seats, you'll be billed immediately for:

The 10 additional Chat seats (prorated for the 10 months remaining)

The 5 Chat + Claude Code seats (prorated for the 10 months remaining)

For step-by-step instructions on purchasing seats, see Purchasing and managing seats on Enterprise plans.

 

 

Configuring spend limits

Set spending controls to manage your organization's consumption:

Sign in as an Owner or Primary Owner.

Navigate to Admin settings > Usage.

Configure spending limits at one or more levels:

Organization level: Maximum monthly spend for all usage across your organization.

Seat tier level: Controls spending for all users of a particular seat type.

Individual level: Specific spending limits for individual users.

These limits work hierarchically—users cannot exceed their individual limits, seat tier limits, or the organization limit.

 

 

Monitoring Usage

Track your organization's consumption through:

The Spending caps by user section in Admin settings > Usage to view month-to-date spending for each member.

Monthly invoices showing detailed usage per user.

Spend limit notifications when users approach their thresholds.

 

 

Seat-based Enterprise plans

Some Enterprise organizations are on seat-based plans with per-seat usage limits rather than consumption billing. If you see "Standard" and "Premium" seats when you navigate to Admin settings > Organization, you're on this plan.

 

Seat-based plans charge a flat monthly fee per seat and include usage limits. For details on this seat type and pricing structure, see Purchasing and managing seats on Enterprise plans.

 

 

Frequently Asked Questions
What happens if I reach my usage limit?

For usage-based plans: If you exceed your organization or individual spend limit, you won't be able to use Claude or Claude Code again until the next billing period begins or an admin increases your limits.

 

For seat-based plans: If extra usage is enabled, you can continue working and extra usage will be billed. If extra usage is not enabled, you won't be able to use Claude or Claude Code until your limits reset or an admin enables extra usage.

 

Can I use my usage budget across both Claude and Claude Code?

Chat + Claude Code seat holders can use their allocation across Claude on web, desktop, and mobile, as well as Claude Code in the terminal.

 

Can I disable usage tracking entirely?

Owners can set limits to "unlimited," but consumption will still be billed. You cannot disable billing for usage—usage-based pricing is core to the Chat and Chat + Claude Code seat models.

 

How do I view my invoices?

Primary Owners and Owners can view and pay invoices from Admin settings > Billing.
