How do I cancel my organization’s Team plan subscription?

# How do I cancel my organization’s Team plan subscription?

Updated this week

An Owner or Primary Owner can cancel Team plan access by navigating to [Admin settings \> Billing](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/billing). Canceling your Team plan subscription means that your organization won't be charged for the next billing cycle. Your team will continue to have access to Claude until the end of the current billing cycle.

Removing a member from your Team plan ends their access immediately. If the removed member occupied an additional seat beyond the five members included by default, you will receive a prorated credit for the current billing cycle. If there are less than five current members, you can still add up to five members until the end of the billing cycle. For all other membership changes, you would need to resubscribe.
