Creating a new Team organization

To get started with the Team plan, navigate to claude.ai/login and enter your work email address. Follow the onboarding prompts and select the Team plan.

 

Requirements to sign up for a Team plan

We require a business email address associated with your company or organization. Public domain email addresses (such as @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, @hotmail.com, etc.) are not accepted at this time.

All team members must have an email address with one of your organization's allowed email domains to be invited to the account.

During sign-up, you can choose between monthly or annual billing options.

Team plans require a minimum of five members and are not intended for individual use.

Upgrading from an individual plan to the Team plan

If you already have a free or paid Claude account associated with your work email and wish to create a Team plan, sign into your account, then visit claude.ai/upgrade. Follow the steps to create your Team.

Upgrading to the Team plan will create a new Claude organization, and your individual free or paid account (Pro or Max) will remain separate. You can toggle between them by clicking your initials or name in the lower left, then selecting the account you'd like to access.

Team plan organizations are separate from free and paid individual Claude accounts. Data cannot be transferred between the separate instances.

If you only want to use your Team plan after upgrading, you'll need to cancel your paid subscription and/or delete your free or paid individual Claude account separately.
