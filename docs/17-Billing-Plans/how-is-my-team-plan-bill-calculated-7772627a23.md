Billing examples
Annual plan example

On January 1 (the start date of your annual subscription), your annual plan has 10 standard seats. The amount charged would be $2,400 ($20 × 10 seats × 12 months) due on January 1st.

 

On April 1st, you decide to upgrade five of the existing standard seats to premium seats. Since there are 275 days remaining in your subscription year, the prorated cost for the seat upgrades would be: ($80 × 5 seats × 12 months) × (275 days ÷ 365 days in the year) = $3,616.44. Your payment method will be charged $3,616.44 on April 1st for the seat upgrades for the remainder of the subscription year.

 

If you remove members during your subscription year, their seats will become available to assign to other team members.

 

Taxes are not included in this example.

 

Monthly plan example

On January 1 (the first day of your billing cycle), your Team plan has 10 standard seats. The amount charged would be $250 ($25 × 10 seats) due on January 1st.

 

On January 15th, you decide to upgrade five standard seats to premium seats. Since there are 16 days remaining in January, the prorated cost for the seat upgrades would be: ($100 × 5 seats × 16 days) ÷ 31 days in January = $258.06. Your payment method will be charged $258.06 on January 15th for the seat upgrades in January.

 

You will be charged for the number of members on your team at the beginning of each billing cycle. If you remove members in the middle of a billing cycle, their seats will become available to assign to other team members.

 

Taxes are not included in this example.
