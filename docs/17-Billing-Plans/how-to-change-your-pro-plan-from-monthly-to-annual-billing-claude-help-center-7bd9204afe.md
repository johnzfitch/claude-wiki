Save on your Pro plan subscription by switching from monthly to annual billing. When you upgrade, any remaining time on your current monthly subscription will be credited to your new annual plan invoice.

## To switch from monthly to annual billing

1.  Navigate to [Settings \> Billing](https://claude.ai/settings/billing).

2.  Click "Adjust plan" next to your Pro subscription details.

3.  From [the upgrade page](https://claude.ai/upgrade), select "Get Pro annual plan"

4.  Review the annual price on the next screen.

5.  Click "Confirm subscription."

## What happens next?

- Your subscription billing period switches from monthly to annual immediately.

- Any unused time from your monthly subscription will be automatically credited to your first annual invoice. You’ll see this credit as a separate line item on your invoice.

- Your next billing date will be set to one year from the date you switch.

- You can cancel your subscription at any time from your billing settings. See [How do I cancel my paid Claude subscription?](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8325617-how-do-i-cancel-my-paid-claude-subscription) for more information.
