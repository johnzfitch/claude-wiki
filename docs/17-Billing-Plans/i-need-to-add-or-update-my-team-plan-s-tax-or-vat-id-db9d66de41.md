Adding your Tax or VAT ID during signup

When you sign up for a Team plan, you may have the option to enter your Tax or VAT ID depending on your location:

During the signup process, enter your address information.

If your address is eligible for tax purposes, an optional field for your Tax or VAT ID will appear.

Enter your Tax or VAT ID in the provided field.

If the ID is entered correctly, you'll be able to proceed with your signup.

Important: If you're signing up as a business and want to use a name other than the one tied to your payment method, an organization Owner should check the "Use a different name on invoices" box when adding or updating your payment method in Admin settings > Billing. Then, enter your company name in the "Bill to" field to ensure it is reflected correctly on your invoice.

 

Updating your Tax or VAT ID after signup

Note: Updates to your billing details will only apply to future billing cycles. Previously completed invoices cannot be updated retroactively.

If you need to add or update your Tax or VAT ID after you've already signed up, follow these steps:

Navigate to your Billing Settings.

Click on the "Update" button next to your payment method.

In the payment update form, you should see a field to enter or update your Tax or VAT ID.

Enter or modify your Tax or VAT ID as needed.

Save your changes.

Note: Your billing address determines your tax jurisdiction. See Understanding your billing address and tax calculation for details on how to view or update your billing address.
