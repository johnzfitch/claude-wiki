Where can I find the invoice or receipt for my Pro or Max plan payment?

If you are subscribed to a paid plan (Pro or Max), follow these steps to access your invoices:

Click on your initials or name in the lower left corner and select “Settings” from the menu.

Navigate to Settings > Billing.

Find the Invoices section.

Click the "View" button next to the invoice you want to open.

Additionally, all invoices are automatically emailed to your billing email address. To find previously emailed invoices in your inbox, search by the subject line "Your receipt from Anthropic."

 

How can I edit the billing details for my existing paid Claude subscription?

Click on your initials or name in the lower left corner and select “Settings” from the menu.

Navigate to Settings > Billing.

Click the "Update" button next to your payment method.

Enter your new billing details in the payment update form.

Click "Update" to save your changes.

Your updated payment method will be charged the next time your subscription renews.

 

How can I use a different name on my invoices?

If you want to use a name other than the one tied to your payment method, check the "Use a different name on invoices" box when adding or updating your payment method in Settings > Billing.

 

 

How can I edit a paid invoice?

Once an invoice is paid, there isn't a way to edit the information on the finalized invoice. Additionally, our internal teams cannot reissue paid invoices or modify information on previous invoices.

 

Can I change the date I'm charged for my Pro or Max subscription?

No, there isn't a direct way to change your subscription billing date. However, you can unsubscribe from your current plan, then resubscribe on your preferred billing date to establish your new monthly billing cycle on a different date.

 

What alternate payment methods are available?

We only accept credit or debit cards for Pro or Max plan payments.

 

I have a paid plan, but my account is showing as free; how can I access my paid account?

If you've paid for a Pro or Max plan but are not seeing this reflected in your account, there are two things you should check:

You've logged in with a different email. We recommend trying to sign in with any alternative emails you may have used to create your paid account.

Your payment method failed and your account was downgraded. To check this, navigate to Settings > Billing to confirm your recent payment status and update your payment method or billing details if needed.
