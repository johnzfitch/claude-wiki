What payment methods can I use to pay for the Team plan?

Accepted payment methods are credit, debit, or prepaid cards. Other forms of payment are not accepted at this time.

 

How do I update my billing information and payment method?

An organization Owner can update your Team plan’s payment method by navigating to Admin settings > Billing.

Note: Your billing address determines your tax jurisdiction. See Understanding your billing address and tax calculation for details on how to view or update your billing address.

How can I change my billing email address?

Your organization's billing address determines where your invoices are sent. You can request to change this email address, or add additional billing email addresses, by contacting our Support team. Note that an organization Owner must authorize any changes to your billing address. For additional invoice recipients, the account Owner must be copied on the request. Once approved, all future invoices will be sent to the new email address(es).

 

How can I use a different name on my invoices?

If you want to use a name other than the one tied to your payment method, an organization Owner should check the "Use a different name on invoices" box when adding or updating your payment method in Admin settings > Billing:

 

 

When will I be billed?

Your payment method on file will be charged at the beginning of your billing cycle. The amount will be based on the number of members on your team at the beginning of the billing cycle. If you add or remove members from your team during the billing cycle, you will be credited or charged the prorated amount immediately. See How is my Team plan bill calculated? for more information about Team plan pricing.

 

Where can I find the invoice or receipt for my Team plan payment?

An organization Owner can follow these steps to access invoices:

Navigate to Admin settings > Billing.

Find the Invoices section.

Click the "View" button next to the invoice you want to open.

A new Stripe tab will open.

Click "Download invoice."

All invoices are automatically emailed to your organization's billing email address(es), so recipients can also search using the subject line "Your receipt from Anthropic" to find previous invoice emails.

 

My organization is tax-exempt; how can I remove the tax from our monthly invoices for our Team plan account?

It's not currently possible to create a tax-exempt Team plan account while signing up. However, after subscribing to the Team plan, you can send your tax-free verification document to our Support team for review. After our Billing team reviews the document, we can manually mark your billing account as exempt and issue a credit note to refund any tax charges.

 

Please click on the message icon in the bottom right of our Help Center to contact our Support team and share the relevant documentation.

 

My Team plan access is no longer active and I want to resubscribe.

An organization Owner can resubscribe for Team plan access by navigating to Admin settings > Billing.
