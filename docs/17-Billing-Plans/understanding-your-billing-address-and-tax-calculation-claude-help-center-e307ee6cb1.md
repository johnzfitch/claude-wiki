Your billing address determines how taxes are calculated on your Claude purchases. This address should represent the primary place of business receiving the product.

## How billing addresses work by plan type

### Pro, Max, and self-serve Team plans

Your billing address is automatically set to match your payment method's billing address. To update it, navigate to [Settings \> Billing](http://claude.ai/settings/billing) and click “Update” to the right of your current payment method.

### Sales-assisted Team plans and Enterprise plans

You can update your billing address directly in Settings → Billing → Billing Addresses. Changes take effect immediately for future invoices.

### API (usage tier 1-4 / self-serve)

Your billing address is tied to your payment method. Update your payment method by navigating to [Settings \> Billing in the Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/billing) and clicking the pencil icon to the right of your current card number to change your billing address.

### Paid API contracts

You can update your billing address directly in the Claude Console under Settings → Billing → Billing Addresses.

## Requesting a different billing address

If you need a billing address that differs from your payment method address, contact our Support team with documentation verifying your primary business location:

- **Non-US customers:** VAT registration certificate matching your requested location

- **US customers:** State of incorporation, business license, or tax ID documentation

Once verified, your billing address won't automatically update when you change payment methods.
