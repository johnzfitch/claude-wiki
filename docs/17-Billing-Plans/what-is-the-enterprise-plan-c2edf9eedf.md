The Enterprise plan is designed for organizations that require advanced capabilities, enhanced security, and scalable solutions to empower every employee with AI. This plan builds upon the features of our Team plan, providing a robust set of tools and resources to meet the complex needs of your business.

 

 

What's included in the Enterprise plan?

The Enterprise plan supports deep, cross-functional workflows and includes everything in the Team plan in addition to the following features:

Enterprise-grade security features to ensure the safety and compliance of your organization's data including:

Audit Logs: Capture key information about user actions, system events, and data access.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)

Custom data retention controls

Compliance API: Programmatically access Claude usage data including activity logs, chat histories, and file content, with filtering capabilities by user and time range.

Enhanced context window that enables users to upload hundreds of sales transcripts, dozens of 100+ page documents, and 100K lines of code.

When using Claude Sonnet 4.5, there is a 500k context window when chatting with Claude and a 1M context window for Claude Code.

The standard 200k context window is available when chatting with all other models.

Increased usage, which means more messages with Claude.

Connectors for your workplace tools: Connect Claude to Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, Microsoft 365, and Slack to search and retrieve context from your existing documents, emails, calendars, and team communications—without manual uploads.

 

 

Seat types and billing

Enterprise plans offer two seat types. What's included in each seat type depends on your billing model:

Usage-based billing models offer Chat and Chat + Claude Code seats, with costs based on a base seat fee plus actual token consumption.

Seat-based billing models offer Standard and Premium seats, with flat monthly fees that include usage limits.

Note: Only existing Enterprise organizations use the seat-based billing model. All new Enterprise organizations will use the usage-based billing model.

For details on seat types and how to manage them, see Purchasing and managing seats on Enterprise plans.

 

For additional information about billing mechanics, see How am I billed for my Enterprise plan?

 

 

Do Enterprise plans have any usage limits?

This depends on the billing model your Enterprise organization is using.

 

If your organization uses a usage-based billing model with Chat and Chat + Claude Code seats, there are no plan or seat-specific usage limits, as the billing model charges based on consumption.

 

If your organization uses a seat-based billing model with Standard and Premium seats, your usage limit depends on the seat type you’re assigned to. Both Standard and Premium seats on the Enterprise plan offer more usage per session than the Pro plan, and have weekly usage limits that apply across all models and reset seven days after your session starts.

 

Do usage limits apply across the team or to individual members?

If you’re on a usage-based Enterprise plan, all users share one organizational token pool rather than individual allocations per user based on their seat type. For more information, see How am I billed for my Enterprise plan?

 

Usage limits on seat-based Enterprise plans are per-member, rather than applied to the team as a whole.

 

How do I increase my seat-based Enterprise plan usage limits?

Your seat-based Enterprise plan organization can enable extra usage to allow team members on all seat types to continue working with Claude and Claude Code after reaching their included usage limits. See this article for more information: Extra usage for Team and seat-based Enterprise plans.
