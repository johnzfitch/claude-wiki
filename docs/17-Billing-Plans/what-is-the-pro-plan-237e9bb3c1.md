This article is about paid Pro plans for individual consumers. If you're part of an organization looking to use Claude with your team, refer to Team and Enterprise Plans.

The Pro plan is a paid plan for our Claude chat experience. It is currently available in certain supported locations.

 

Key Benefits

The benefits of the Pro plan are:

At least five times the usage per session compared to our free service.

Priority access to Claude during high-traffic periods.

Early access to new features that help you get the most out of Claude.

Ability to choose another model with the model selector.

Access to projects and knowledge bases.

Claude Code access

Note: The Pro plan does not include API usage through the Claude Console. If you're interested in both enhanced Claude features and the Claude API, you'll need to set up Console access to pay for API usage separately.

 

 

How much does the Pro plan cost?

The Pro plan is available for $20 per month (US), with pricing in your local currency where supported. Monthly pricing varies by region, and some regions include applicable taxes in the displayed price while others add tax at checkout.

 

You can choose to save with an annual subscription plan. Annual subscriptions are billed once yearly at a discounted rate.

 

Visit claude.ai/upgrade or check your mobile app store for current pricing in your region.

 

How can I get a free or discounted Pro plan?

We do not offer standard discounted pricing any of our paid plans, including Pro plans. With that said, anyone in a supported location can access the free version of Claude by navigating to claude.ai and signing up using an email address.

 

We occasionally run limited-time promotions, but we don't have any standing discounts available upon request. These promotional offers are typically announced through our official channels when available. If you're interested in potential future promotions, we recommend following our official social media accounts or signing up for our newsletter to be notified of any special offers. Our Support team cannot issue one-off discounts or coupons.

 

 

Does the Pro plan have any usage limits?

Yes. During peak hours, the Pro plan offers at least five times the usage per session compared to our free service. The number of messages you can send will vary based on message length, including the length of files you attach, the length of your current conversation, and the model or feature you use. Your session-based usage limit will reset every five hours.

 

Pro plans also have a weekly usage limit that applies across all models and resets seven days after your session starts.

 

In addition, to manage capacity and ensure fair access to all users, we may limit your usage in other ways, such as weekly and monthly caps or model and feature usage, at our discretion.

 

For more information about usage and length limits, refer to Understanding usage and length limits. For guidance on using your Pro capacity efficiently, we also have Usage limit best practices.

 

How do I increase my Pro plan usage limits?

Our Max plans offer more usage for individuals than Pro plans. For additional information, see What is the Max plan?

 

Pro subscribers can also enable extra usage to continue working with Claude beyond the plan’s included usage limits. For more information and instructions for enabling this feature, see Extra usage for paid Claude plans.
