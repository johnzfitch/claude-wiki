# Anthropic Partners with Google Cloud

Feb 3, 2023

Anthropic, an AI safety and research company, has [selected](https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2023-02-03-Anthropic-Forges-Partnership-With-Google-Cloud-to-Help-Deliver-Reliable-and-Responsible-AI) Google Cloud as its cloud provider. The partnership is designed so that the companies can co-develop AI computing systems; Anthropic will leverage Google Cloud's cutting-edge GPU and TPU clusters to train, scale, and deploy its AI systems.  
  
“We're partnering with Google Cloud to support the next phase of Anthropic, where we're going to deploy our AI systems to a larger set of people,” said Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. “This partnership gives us the cloud infrastructure performance and scale we need.”  
  
Anthropic is focused on developing and deploying Claude, an AI assistant based on the company's research into building safe, steerable AI. Anthropic has created safety techniques like [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) to create AI technologies that are easier to rely on and understand.  
  
“We are eager to use the Google Cloud infrastructure to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. This partnership with Google Cloud will let us build a more robust AI platform,” said Dario Amodei.
