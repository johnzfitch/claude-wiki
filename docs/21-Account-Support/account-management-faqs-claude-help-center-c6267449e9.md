## How do I change my team name?

Owners can update the team name on their plan by navigating to [Admin settings \> Organization](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/organization) and clicking "Update" under the current team name. Type in a new name and click "Save."

## How can I change a Team or Enterprise plan member’s name?

It's not possible to change another user's name on their behalf, but a user can edit their own name by following these steps:

1.  Log in to your Claude account.

2.  Navigate to [Settings \> General](http://claude.ai/settings/general).

3.  Make edits to the "Full name" field and click "Save changes."

## Can I create multiple teams?

**For Team plans:**

Yes, you can create multiple teams by purchasing multiple Team plans. To create a new Team plan, you can navigate directly to our team creation page and start by naming your team.

**For Enterprise plans:**

If you're interested in purchasing multiple Enterprise plans, you can [reach out to our Sales team](https://claude.com/contact-sales).

## How do I view a list of all members on a team?

Admins and Owners can view a list of all members on a team by navigating to [Admin settings \> Organization](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/organization).

## How can I view or add allowed email domains?

The email domain that was used to create your Team or Enterprise plan organization is the allowed email domain for your team members. After the account is created, Owners of organizations that are not using domain capture can add additional domains by following these steps:

1.  Navigate to [Admin settings \> Organization](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/organization).

2.  Click the pencil icon under **Allowed email domains**.

3.  In the **Update organization email domains** modal that appears, enter the new domain.

4.  Click the "+" button to add the domain.

5.  Click the "Save" button.

Owners can remove domains by opening up the same modal and clicking the trash can icon to the right of the domain:

We currently require a business email address associated with your company or organization in order to purchase a Team or Enterprise plan, and public domain emails are not supported (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.).
