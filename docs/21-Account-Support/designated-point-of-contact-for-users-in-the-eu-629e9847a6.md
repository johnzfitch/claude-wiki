European Union Monthly Active Recipients

In accordance with our obligations under Article 24(2) of the DSA, Anthropic publishes information on the average ‘monthly active recipients’ of our online services in the European Union, calculated over a six-month period.
​
Anthropic has calculated its average monthly active recipients in the EU for the six-month period ending 31 October 2025, and has concluded that it falls well below the 45 million threshold set out in Article 33(1) of the DSA.
​
Anthropic will continue to monitor the number of average monthly active recipients of its services in the EU and will publish updated information at least every 6 months.
