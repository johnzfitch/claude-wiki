## Troubleshooting

### Q: I'm struggling to log in with SSO

Your SSO configuration is managed by the Primary Owner or Owner on your account. Contact your university's dedicated support channel to troubleshoot SSO/login issues.

### Q: I'm seeing a warning message about remaining messages

Claude has a usage limit that varies based on message length, file attachments, and conversation length. You'll receive warning messages before reaching the limit. When you see the first warning, consider following these [usage tips](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9797557-usage-limit-best-practices).

### Q: I'm seeing an error message about length limit

This appears when your prompt exceeds Claude's available context window. When this happens, either:

- Shorten your prompt/attachments

- Start a new conversation

### Q: I already have a Claude account using my university email

When you log in, you can select between your previous account and the new university-sponsored account. You can't migrate data between accounts, but you can [export data](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9450526-how-can-i-export-my-claude-ai-data) from your existing account and upload the conversation data (JSON format) to your new account.
