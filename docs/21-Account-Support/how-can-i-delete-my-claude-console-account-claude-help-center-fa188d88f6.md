Only Console Admins can request deletion. See [Claude Console Roles and Permissions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10186004-claude-console-roles-and-permissions) for a full overview of your role's capabilities.

This article explains how a Claude Console Admin can delete their organization via Console settings. Note that deletion impacts all members of a Console organization.

## Before deletion

- Confirm which specific Console organization needs to be deleted.

- Deletion affects all users within the organization, so ensure they are notified prior to deletion.

- Back up any necessary data as this action cannot be reversed after seven days.

## How to delete your Console organization

1.  Log in to your Console Admin account.

2.  Navigate to [Settings \> Organization](https://platform.claude.com/settings/organization).

3.  Click the red “Delete organization” button.

4.  A **Delete \[your org name\]** modal will appear; click “Acknowledge & continue” to move forward.

5.  To confirm the deletion, type “delete \[your org name\]” as indicated in the modal to make the button clickable, then click “Delete this organization.”

6.  You will see an “Organization deleted” confirmation in the upper right corner of your screen.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I have an outstanding balance; how can I delete my Console organization?
