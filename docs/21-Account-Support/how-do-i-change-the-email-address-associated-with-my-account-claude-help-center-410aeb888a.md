How do I change the email address associated with my account?

# How do I change the email address associated with my account?

Updated this week

It's not possible to change the email address associated with your Claude account at this time. When creating an account, please make sure you use an email you'll have long-term access to.

If you need to use Claude with a different email address, do the following:

### 1. If you have a paid plan (Pro or Max), follow these steps to cancel it

- Log in to your Claude account.

- Click on your initials or name in the bottom left corner.

- Navigate to [Settings \> Billing](https://claude.ai/settings/billing).

- Find the **Cancellation** section and click "Cancel."

Your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period and you can continue using your paid plan until your billing period ends.

**Note:** To avoid charges for the next billing period, cancel at least 24 hours before your next billing date.

If you lost access to the email address you used and can't log in to your account, please contact our Support team from an email address you can access and 'cc' the email in question on your response. Confirm that you want to cancel the subscription associated with the copied email address so our team can assist.

### 2. Unlink your phone number from the account

If you want to use the same phone number to verify your new Claude account, you should also request that we unlink it from the old account when you 'cc' that email address.

### 3. Delete the old account

After cancelling your previous subscription and unlinking your phone number, you can delete your account by navigating to [Settings \> Account](https://claude.ai/settings/account), clicking "Delete Account," and following the prompts. **Please note that deleting your account is permanent** and you will no longer have access to saved chats. If you wish to keep your data, we recommend exporting it before deletion by following the steps in [How can I export my Claude data?](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9450526-how-can-i-export-my-claude-data)

\
If you see "Contact support" instead of a "Delete account" button, you'll need to [reach out to our Support team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) to request assistance with deletion.
