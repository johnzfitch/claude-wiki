How does subscription renewal work for Pro plans?

After subscribing for a Pro plan, your subscription will be set to automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly or annual) by default. This ensures uninterrupted access to Pro features. However, you have the flexibility to cancel your paid plan at any time if you choose not to continue.

 

I am outside of your supported locations; can I subscribe to the Pro plan?

No. Paid plans are only available for users physically located in one of our supported locations, and we require a phone number from a supported location to create an account.

 

Is there still a free version of Claude?

Yes. You can still access the free version of Claude without subscribing for a paid plan. Note that like Pro, the free version of Claude is only available to customers physically located in one of our supported regions.
