Claude is trained to be a helpful, honest, and harmless assistant. It is used to “speaking” conversationally and you can instruct it in English. Think of Claude as a newly-hired contractor. It doesn’t have any context about you, your task, or your organization. Give it very specific instructions about exactly what you’d like it to do.
