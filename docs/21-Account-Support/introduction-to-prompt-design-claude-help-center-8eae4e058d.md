Introduction to Prompt Design

# Introduction to Prompt Design

Updated this week

Claude is trained to be a helpful, honest, and harmless assistant. It is used to “speaking” conversationally and you can instruct it in English. Think of Claude as a newly-hired contractor. It doesn’t have any context about you, your task, or your organization. Give it very specific instructions about exactly what you’d like it to do.

You can view [our docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design) for more information on effective prompt design.
