When you open Claude on a web browser (claude.ai), the desktop app, or a mobile app, you will see two different options for logging in to your Claude account.

 

 

Continue with Google

Click “Continue with Google” if you want to use your Google account credentials to log in to Claude. This opens a modal where you can enter your Google email address and password. After entering your credentials and clicking “Next,” you will be authenticated into your Claude account.

 

Continue with email

If you’d prefer to use your email address to log in, enter it in the field pictured above, and click “Continue with email.” This will send you an email with the subject line “Secure link to log in to Claude.ai” and a login link.

 

Clicking the link on the same device

If you requested the login email and clicked the link using the same device, you’ll be automatically redirected to your logged-in Claude account.

 

Clicking the link on another device

If you requested the login email and clicked the link using a different device (requesting from a web browser and clicking the email link on a phone, for example), then you will still see a “Sign in with Claude.ai” link in the email, but clicking it will generate a verification code. You should enter this code on the original device where you requested the login email to authenticate.

 

Troubleshooting
I entered my email address but I haven’t received my login email.

If you requested a login email but you haven’t received it yet, do the following:

Check your spam and junk folders for emails from @mail.anthropic.com.

Check your server's quarantined emails.

Whitelist @mail.anthropic.com in your email settings.

Try logging in again after a few minutes.

Note: Business, government, or .edu email users may need to contact their IT department to adjust email security settings.

I received the email but I'm still having trouble logging in.

If you received the login email but can’t log in with the link or code, take note of the error message you’re seeing. If you’re creating an account or logging in for the first time and seeing a message about your phone number, please refer to Verifying your phone number.

 

Otherwise, visit the Claude status page to check if there are any known service disruptions or maintenance activities. If the status page shows an ongoing system-wide incident, it's best to wait for service restoration before attempting further troubleshooting.

 

Frequently Asked Questions
How can I set a password for my Claude account?

It’s not possible to create a dedicated password for your Claude account at this time.

 

Can I use my Claude account across multiple devices?

To use your Claude account across multiple devices, enter the same email address you use to log in on your usual device. For example, if you signed up for your Claude account on a web browser, you can access the same account on the Claude mobile apps by entering the same email address when you log in.

 

I have multiple accounts – how can I switch between them?

If you have both an individual Claude account and a Team or Enterprise plan account tied to the same email address, follow these steps to switch to your other account:

Click your initials in the bottom left corner.

Select the desired account.

Look for the check mark indicating the active account.

I don’t want to use “Continue with Google” to log in anymore; how can I revoke access to my Google account?

If you've previously authenticated using Google, you can follow these steps to unlink your Google account from Claude and use only the emailed login link moving forward:

Visit https://myaccount.google.com/connections.

Locate “Claude by Anthropic” in the list and click on it.

Click "See details."

Click the "Stop using Sign in with Google” button. 

You should also follow these steps if you're experiencing issues with Google login. After clearing your existing connection, try logging in to Claude again using "Continue with Google."

 

I used Apple’s Hide My Email feature to create my Claude account – how can I log in on another device?

If you signed up for your Claude account using Apple's Hide My Email feature, follow these steps to log in:

Use your @privaterelay.appleid.com email address.

Click "Continue with email" on Claude, Claude Desktop, or Claude Mobile.

A secure login link will be sent to your Apple ID email.

Click the “Sign in with Claude.ai” link in the email you received to log in.

If you are already logged in to Claude for iOS, you can see the email address you used:
