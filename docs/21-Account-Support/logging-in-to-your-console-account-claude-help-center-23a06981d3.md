When you navigate to the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com), you will see two different options for logging in to your Console account.

## Continue with Google

Click "Continue with Google" if you want to use your Google account credentials to log in to the Console. This opens a modal where you can enter your Google email address and password. After entering your credentials and clicking "Next," you will be authenticated into your Console account.

## Continue with email

If you'd prefer to use your email address to log in, enter it in the field pictured above, and click "Continue with email." This will send you an email with the subject line *"Secure link to log in to Claude Console"* and a login link.

### Clicking the link on the same device

If you requested the login email and clicked the link using the same device, you'll be automatically redirected to your logged-in Console account.

### Clicking the link on another device

If you requested the login email and clicked the link using a different device (requesting from a web browser and clicking the email link on a phone, for example), then you will still see a "Sign in to Claude Console" button in the email, but clicking it will generate a verification code. You should enter this code on the original device where you requested the login email to authenticate.

## Troubleshooting

### I entered my email address but I haven't received my login email.

If you requested a login email but you haven't received it yet, do the following:

- Check your spam and junk folders for emails from @mail.anthropic.com.

- Check your server's quarantined emails.

- Whitelist @mail.anthropic.com in your email settings.

- Try logging in again after a few minutes.

**Note:** Business, government, or .edu email users may need to contact their IT department to adjust email security settings.

### I received the email but I'm still having trouble logging in.

If you received the login email but can't log in with the link or code, take note of the error message you're seeing. Visit the [Claude status page](https://status.claude.com/) to check if there are any known service disruptions or maintenance activities. If the status page shows an ongoing system-wide incident, it's best to wait for service restoration before attempting further troubleshooting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I set a password for my Console account?

It's not possible to create a dedicated password for your Console account at this time.

### Does my organization use Single Sign-On (SSO)?

If you're a member of an organization that has configured single sign-on for the Console, you'll be redirected to your SSO provider when you attempt to log in. For information about setting up SSO for your organization, see [Setting up Single Sign-On on the Claude Console](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10280258-setting-up-single-sign-on-on-the-claude-console).

### I have multiple Console accounts – how can I switch between them?

If you're a member of multiple Console organizations tied to the same email address, follow these steps to switch to your other account:

1.  Click your initials in the bottom left corner to open a menu showing all the accounts tied to your logged-in email address.

2.  Select the desired account.

3.  Look for the check mark indicating the active account.

### I don't want to use "Continue with Google" to log in anymore; how can I revoke access to my Google account?

If you've previously authenticated using Google, you can follow these steps to unlink your Google account from the Console and use only the emailed login link moving forward:

1.  Visit [https://myaccount.google.com/connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections).

2.  Locate "Claude by Anthropic" in the list and click on it.

3.  Click "See details."

4.  Click the "Stop using Sign in with Google" button.

### Can I have both a Claude account and a Console account?

Yes, you can have both a Claude account (for using Claude at claude.ai) and a Console account (for accessing the Workbench and Claude API). These are separate accounts, though you can use the same email address for both.
