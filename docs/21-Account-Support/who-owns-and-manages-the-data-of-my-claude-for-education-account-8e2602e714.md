These settings reflect Anthropic’s default approach to Claude for Education, but we understand that universities may have legitimate needs to access data. In these situations, the Primary Owner will need to reach out to Anthropic support to request and enable access.

 

This includes the ability to request access to your user data through data exports, which may contain your conversations with Claude, uploaded files, and usage patterns. Primary Owners can also remove your access to the Claude for Education account if necessary.

 

Your organization determines which Claude services and features you can access in your Claude for Education account and they may choose to limit certain functionality.
