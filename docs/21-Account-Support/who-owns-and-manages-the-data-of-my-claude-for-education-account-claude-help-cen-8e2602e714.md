This article provides important information about your Claude for Education account associated with your university’s Claude for Education partnership. It includes details about data access and control that were shared with you when your Claude for Education account was set up.

*This article is about Claude for Education (a commercial product). For more information about our other commercial products such as Claude for Work and the Anthropic API see [here](https://privacy.anthropic.com/en/articles/9265372-who-owns-and-manages-the-data-of-my-team).

## Default Settings and Account Management

Your university’s organization's designated Primary Owner manages your Claude for Education account and all associated data.

On Claude for Education, by default, the following capabilities are disabled by default:

- Primary Owner Data Exports

- Audit Log

- Thumbs Feedback

These settings reflect Anthropic’s default approach to Claude for Education, but we understand that universities may have legitimate needs to access data. In these situations, the Primary Owner will need to reach out to [Anthropic support](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support) to request and enable access.

This includes the ability to request access to your user data through data exports, which may contain your conversations with Claude, uploaded files, and usage patterns. Primary Owners can also remove your access to the Claude for Education account if necessary.

Your organization determines which Claude services and features you can access in your Claude for Education account and they may choose to limit certain functionality.

## Governing Agreements

The use of your Claude for Education plan account is governed by the agreement between Anthropic and your university. Please contact your Claude for Education administrator for details of this agreement.

While Anthropic’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) describes how we collect, use and share personal information when acting as a data controller in providing the Claude services to your university, please note that the Anthropic [Consumer Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/consumer-terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) do not apply to the use of the Claude for Education plan where Anthropic acts as the data processor.\
​

## Organizational Policies

Your organization may have its own internal policies regarding usage of Claude for Education. Please refer to your university’s policies for guidance.

## Questions

If you have any questions about your Claude for Education plan account, we encourage you to contact your university’s administrator(s).
