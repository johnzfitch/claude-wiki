For medical emergencies, active injuries, or situations where you're in immediate physical danger, please contact emergency services (such as 911 in the US and Canada, or 112 in much of Europe) or go to your nearest emergency room.

 

This guidance was developed in partnership with ThroughLine.

 

Claude may sometimes display crisis support resources in a banner or in its responses. These resources are designed to connect you with people who specialize in helping during difficult moments.

 

Why am I seeing a crisis support message?

Claude may show a banner with connections to crisis support resources when your conversation touches on topics that may be related to emotional distress, suicidal thoughts, or self-harm. This banner is surfaced by a separate detection system, not from Claude directly.

 

These resources are there to make it easier to get help if you want it. You decide whether to use these resources, and there are no consequences for your account based on your decision to access resources.

 

If the banner doesn't feel relevant to your situation, that's completely okay - you can simply dismiss it. We'd rather offer support when it's not needed than miss an opportunity to help someone who could use it. After you see the banner, it won't appear again for about two hours, but you can always access crisis resources at claude.findahelpline.com anytime.

 

What is a crisis helpline?

Crisis helplines are free services staffed by trained personnel (who could be a volunteer, a counselor, or an individual who has been through similar situations) who provide support during tough times. You can usually reach them through multiple options (often phone, text, and/or online chat). Most operate around the clock, every day of the year, so help is available whenever you need it.

 

What helplines offer

A caring ear: Responders are there to hear what you're experiencing, without judgment or criticism.

Safety support: If you're having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, they can work with you to create a plan for staying safe.

In-the-moment guidance: They can help you work through overwhelming feelings and figure out next steps.

Connections to ongoing care: They can point you toward community resources, support groups, or mental health services if you're looking for longer-term help.

Support for concerned loved ones: If you’re worried about a friend or family member, helplines can help you think through how to be there for them.

You don't need to be at a breaking point to reach out. People contact helplines for all kinds of reasons - sometimes just to have someone listen.

 

How to connect with a helpline

Contacting a helpline is straightforward, and there's no special preparation needed:

Choose your method: Many helplines let you call, text, or chat online. You can check what's available and pick whichever feels most comfortable for you.

Speak freely: Share what's on your mind however it comes out. There's no script to follow. Something like "I'm not sure where to start" works perfectly fine.

Feel free to let them guide the conversation: The helpline responder will ask some questions to understand your situation and how they can best support you. You're always in control of what you share and where the conversation goes.

Share only what you're comfortable with: You can remain anonymous. There’s no requirement to provide your name or any identifying details.

A few things to keep in mind

Crisis helplines provide immediate support, not ongoing therapy. However, they can help connect you with longer-term resources.

For medical emergencies, active injuries, or situations where you're in immediate physical danger, please contact emergency services (911 in the US or Canada and 112 in much of Europe) or go to your nearest emergency room.

Understanding who provides what

Crisis helplines and Anthropic are entirely different organizations with different roles. This distinction matters because it affects what kind of help you can get from each. It’s important to note that:

Helpline responders are not Anthropic employees. They specialize in emotional and mental health support. Questions about Claude, your account, technical issues, or billing aren't something they can address.

Your Claude activity stays private. Anthropic doesn't send your conversations to helplines. Helplines have no information about what you've discussed with Claude or any details about your account.

Need help with Claude itself?

For anything related to Claude or your Anthropic account, here's where to go:

Support center: Visit support.anthropic.com

Account questions: Check your account settings for help options

Feedback on responses: The thumbs down button on any Claude response lets you flag concerns

Frequently asked questions

We worked with ThroughLine to provide answers to common questions about using a crisis helpline.

 

Is there a cost for using crisis helplines via ThroughLine?

Crisis helplines don't charge anything. Standard phone or texting rates from your carrier may apply, but the service itself is free.

 

Where can I find a helpline?

If you're in the United States, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is available by call or text. For other countries, a directory of services worldwide maintained by ThroughLine can be found at claude.findahelpline.com.

 

Does talking to a helpline actually make a difference?

Studies consistently show that crisis counseling reduces distress and helps people feel more grounded. Responders are specifically trained to help during difficult moments, including supporting people through thoughts of self-harm.

 

I'm not in a crisis. Is it still okay to call?

Absolutely. Many people reach out when they're stressed, lonely, or just having a hard day. You don't need to meet some threshold of "bad enough" to deserve support.

 

Can I call about someone else I'm worried about?

Yes. Helplines support people who are concerned about others too. They can offer guidance on how to approach the situation and be helpful to the person you care about.

 

Are there options besides phone calls?

Many helplines offer text and online chat alongside traditional phone support. You can use whatever channel feels most comfortable to you.

 

Will the helpline contact my family or anyone else?

Generally, no. Conversations with support personnel are kept confidential. The main exception is if a responder believes there's an immediate, serious safety risk - and even then, they'll typically try to work with you first. Different helplines have slightly different policies, so feel free to ask when you connect.

 

What about non-English speakers or people outside the United States?

Helplines exist in countries around the globe, many offering support in local languages. You can locate services in your region on claude.findahelpline.com.

 

Is it okay to contact a helpline multiple times?

Yes, though some services have guidelines around frequency. Feel free to ask about their approach when you're connected.

 

Does Anthropic send my Claude conversations to helplines?

No. Your interactions with Claude remain with Anthropic. Helpline personnel have no access to your messages, account information, or anything else related to your use of Claude. When you contact a helpline, that's a completely separate conversation.

 

What if I have to wait to speak with someone?

High demand sometimes means wait times. If that happens, you can stay on the line, try reaching out via a different method (chat instead of phone, for instance), or contact an alternative helpline. claude.findahelpline.com lists multiple options for most locations.

 

I feel nervous about reaching out.

That's a common feeling. Helplines understand this and won't push you to share more than you're ready to. You control the pace and depth of the conversation. If it helps, you might start with something simple: "I'm feeling nervous about this call."

 

How are the crisis resources in Claude selected?

We work with ThroughLine, an organization that curates and maintains a global directory of verified crisis helplines. The resources shown are selected based on your location to provide relevant, local support options.
