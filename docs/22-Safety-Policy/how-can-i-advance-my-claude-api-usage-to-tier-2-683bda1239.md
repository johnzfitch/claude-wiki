To qualify for usage Tier 2, you'll need to purchase a cumulative total of $40 of API usage credits on your Claude Console account. Here's what you need to do:

Log into your Console account.

Go to your Console Billing page.

Click on the "Buy credits" button.

Add $40 in usage credits to your balance, either through a single purchase or multiple purchases totaling $40. 

After making this purchase, your account will automatically upgrade to usage Tier 2, increasing your monthly usage limit to $500. You're not allowed to deposit more than your monthly spend limit, which helps minimize the risk of overfunding your account.

 

Refer to our Claude Docs to read more about rate limits and usage tiers.
