Projects are available to all users, including those with free Claude accounts. Free users can create a maximum of five projects.

How to create a project

Hover over the left side of your account and click “Projects,” or navigate directly to this section: claude.ai/projects.

Click "+ New Project" in the upper right corner.

Give your project a name and description (note that Claude will not have access to these details).

If you are on a Team or Enterprise plan, choose the visibility settings:

Keep it private: Only you and members you invite can view or use this project.

Share with your broader organization: Everyone in your organization can view and use this project (where enabled by administrators).

Once your project is set up, you can initiate chats with Claude within the project.

 

Adding content to project knowledge 

You'll find the project knowledge base on the right side of your project's main page. Anything you upload to this space will be used across all of your chats within that project.

 

To add content to your project knowledge base

Click on the "+" button to add content to the project.

Upload relevant documents, text files, or code snippets.

Claude will process this information and use it as context in your chats within the project.

If you are using a paid Claude plan, when your project knowledge approaches the context window limit, Claude will automatically enable RAG mode to expand your project's capacity.

To add project instructions to your project knowledge base

Click on "Set project instructions."

Add instructions for how you'd like Claude to behave and respond and click "Save instructions."

Claude will use these instructions for all the chats within the project.

Note: Context is not shared across chats within a project unless the information is added into the project knowledge base. 

 

Sharing projects

If you are a member of a Team or Enterprise plan organization, you can share projects with other members of your organization.

 

To share a project

Open the project you want to share.

Click the "Share project" button to the right of the project name.

Add individual members using their name or email address, or copy and paste a list of email addresses for bulk sharing.

Select the appropriate permission level for each member:

Can use: Members can see project contents, knowledge, and instructions, and chat within the project, but cannot edit it.

Can edit: Members can modify project instructions and knowledge, update member settings, and actively contribute to the project.

Click "Share" to send invitations.

Managing shared project access

To change permissions: Open the sharing menu and select a new role for the member.

To view who has access: The sharing menu shows all current members and their permission levels.

To remove access: The project creator can click on the member's current role and select "Remove access."

Finding shared projects

Projects that others have shared with you will appear in the "Shared with me" tab on your Projects page. You'll also receive an email notification when someone shares a project with you.

 

 

Starring projects for quick access

Starring a project allows for quick access from your projects and chats list, visible when hovering over the left side of your account. You can star a project from two different areas:

 

From the “Projects” page

Locate the project on the “Projects” page.

Click on the three dots ("..." button) on the upper right corner of the project.

Select "Star" from the menu that appears.

 

From the project

Open the relevant project.

Click on the star icon in the upper right corner.

The project will now appear in your starred items in the left side panel of your account.

 

 

How to move chats into projects

You can move a standalone chat into a project by clicking on the dropdown arrow next to the chat name, then “Add to project”:

 

 

Browse or search for the correct project in the Move chat modal that appears, then click on it to move the chat.

 

 

You can also remove chats from projects, or move them between projects, using the same dropdown menu within the chat:

 

 

You can move chats into projects in bulk from Your chat history page:

 

 

Select the chats you want to move, then click the icon next to the number of selected chats to move them into your project.

 

 

Move chats to manage Claude’s memory

Memory from chat history is available for users on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans on the web, Claude Desktop, and Claude Mobile.

For Team and Enterprise plans using Claude’s memory, the ability to move chats into and out of projects allows you to manage what’s included in memory summaries. Claude maintains separate memory summaries for each individual project, as well as a summary including the rest of your non-project chats. For example, if you accidentally start an unrelated chat in a project and need to remove it from the project-specific memory summary, you can click “Remove from project” so it will be included in Claude’s overall memory summary instead.

How to archive projects

Archiving is a way to organize your projects and declutter your project list. It's particularly useful for completed projects or those you're not actively working on but may need to reference in the future.

Important: When a project is archived, all sharing permissions are reset to private and previous sharing context is wiped for security purposes.

Here's what you need to know about archiving:

Archived projects will appear at the bottom of your main projects list.

You can still access conversations from archived projects.

There is no way to delete archived projects at this time (you must unarchive it first).

To archive a project, follow these steps

Navigate to the project you want to archive.

Click on the three dots ("..." button) in the upper right corner.

Confirm that you want to archive the project.

How to access archived projects

You can access an archived project in the archived projects tab on the Projects page.

 

 

How to unarchive a project

There are two ways to make archived project active again:

 

From the archived projects tab

Locate the archived project.

Click on the three dots ("..." button) in the upper right corner.

Select "Unarchive" from the menu that appears.

 

 

From the project

Navigate to the archived project.

Click on the three dots ("..." button) in the upper right corner.

Confirm that you want to unarchive the project.

 

 

Deleting projects

Note: It's not possible to delete archived projects. To see the option to delete an archived project, you must unarchive it first.

From the “Projects” page

Locate the project on the Projects page.

Click on the three dots ("..." button) on the upper right corner of the project.

Select "Delete" from the menu that appears.

Confirm deletion in the pop-up by clicking "Yes, delete."
