Why am I receiving an 'Output blocked by content filtering policy' error?

# Why am I receiving an 'Output blocked by content filtering policy' error?

Updated this week

Some Claude users may encounter refusals or errors with the message ‘Output blocked by content filtering policy’. These refusals do not reflect Anthropic’s judgments about the propriety of any content. Instead, they generally arise from Anthropic’s efforts to prevent Claude from being used to replicate or regurgitate pre-existing materials. Anthropic takes these steps because Claude’s purpose is to generate new content and ideas, not to reproduce content that already exists. We also prohibit in our terms and policies use of our services in ways that infringe, misappropriate, or violate intellectual property or other legal rights.

We’re mindful that some users may encounter these refusals or errors when they aren’t intending for Claude to replicate or regurgitate anything. We know this can be frustrating, and welcome your feedback and insights as we iterate on our tooling to improve our users’ experiences with our services.

Conversely, if you are receiving these messages because you *are* trying to elicit copyrighted content, we may warn you or, in cases of repeat violations, suspend or terminate your account.
