Our AI for Science Program is specifically designed to support researchers working on high-impact scientific projects, with a particular focus on biology and life sciences applications, by providing free API credits.

If you are a researcher working on applying Generative AI to scientific research and are interested in receiving free API credits, you might qualify for our AI for Science Program. Please complete the following application form with details about your team and research project: [Application Form - Anthropic's AI for Science Program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwDGfVg2lHJ0cc0oF_ilEnjvr_r4_paYi7VLlr5cLNXASdvA/viewform?usp=header).

## About this Program

**Please note that you can access the Claude model family immediately via API by simply creating a [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/) account – you do not need to contact us first.**

- This program provides free API credits for our standard model suite to researchers in academia and nonprofit organizations working on scientific research topics we consider high priority.

- Note that these credits are for API use and do not apply to the Claude web app.

- This program does not provide access to non-standard or non-public models.

- Applicants through this program do not receive exemption from our [Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup). Our Trust & Safety team will follow our standard enforcement procedures and take action whenever an organization's prompt activity hits our violation rate thresholds.

## About our Process

- We evaluate submissions on the first Monday of each month. This schedule helps us manage the program sustainably. Please note that if this timeline poses a significant obstacle for the applicant, it does not block them from simply purchasing API credits in the interim.

- If successful, we will apply up to \$20,000 in API credits to your account for a 6-month period.

- Please note that given the substantial number of applications we receive, we regret that we cannot provide individual responses to unapproved submissions. However, we appreciate the time and effort put into each submission and will carefully review all entries.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who is eligible for the AI for Science Program?

The AI for Science program is designed for researchers attached to research institutions working on high-impact scientific projects, with a particular focus on biology and life sciences applications. We evaluate applications based on scientific merit, potential impact, technical feasibility, and the team's credentials in both their subject area and AI.

### What types of scientific research does this program support?

We support research across various scientific fields, including:

- Biology/Life Sciences

- Chemistry

- Medicine/Healthcare

- Environmental Science

- Physics

- Computer Science

- Earth Sciences

- Other fields with potential for significant scientific impact

We are particularly interested in applications where Claude can assist with understanding complex biological systems, accelerating drug discovery, analyzing genetic data, and other life sciences applications.

### How are applications evaluated?

Applications are evaluated based on:

- Scientific merit: team credentials in subject area and with AI, attached to a research institution

- Potential impact: contribution to critical foundational research and/or clear path to scale an application

- Technical feasibility: value of our model as applied to your use case

- Biosecurity screening: ensuring proposed research could not enable harmful applications

### I would like access to non-standard or nonpublic models for my research. Is this possible?

We understand the potential value this could bring to your work, however, to maintain the sustainability of this free, high-volume program, we are unable to extend access to any nonpublic or experimental models through this AI for Science program. This non-standard or nonpublic model access is reserved for a very limited number of pre-deployment testing partnerships, which are not part of this program. We do not currently provide finetuning access via an API at this time. Finetuning access to Claude models is in preview mode via AWS Bedrock and not covered via this program. We continually evaluate our offerings and may consider expanding access to additional models in the future.

### I run a research program with many researchers and collaborators. What's the best way for us to apply for free API credits via this program?

For research programs with multiple researchers and collaborators, we recommend setting up a single account to represent your entire program, and submit an application through our application form.

If approved, we'll allocate credits to a single organization ID, which you can then flexibly distribute among your researchers. This enables you to easily add or remove collaborators as needed, monitor usage across your team, and ensure compliance with our policies.

If your program's needs change significantly over time, please submit an updated application to discuss potential adjustments to your allocation.

### I am performing red-teaming or jailbreaking research. Is there a way to make sure our account does not get flagged for potentially breaking your Usage Policy while our researchers are purposefully red-teaming?

We appreciate your interest in conducting red-teaming or jailbreaking research, as it plays a crucial role in improving AI safety. However, to maintain the sustainability of our AI for Science Program, participants are not exempt from our [Usage Policy.](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup) Our Trust & Safety team will follow our standard enforcement procedures and take action whenever an organization's prompt activity hits our violation rate thresholds.
