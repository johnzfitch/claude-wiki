## Your Journey, Your Pace

There's no single "right" way to integrate Claude into your work. Some team members dive in quickly while others prefer a gradual approach. Both are valid. The goal is to find the ways Claude can genuinely support your mission-driven work—saving you time on routine tasks so you can focus more energy on the people and programs that matter most.
