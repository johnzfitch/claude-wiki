## What is Claude for Life Sciences

Claude for Life Sciences enhances Claude with specialized capabilities for life sciences research. It connects Claude to the data sources and tools scientists use daily, eliminating the need to toggle between platforms and enabling insights that span your entire R&D ecosystem to accelerate discovery timelines while maintaining publication-quality scientific rigor.

## How do I access life sciences tools and features?

Individuals can access Claude for Life Sciences features and tools from a [Claude Pro](https://claude.com/pricing) or [Claude Max](https://claude.com/pricing) account. For teams with less than 20 seats, you can access Claude for Life Sciences from a [Team plan](https://claude.com/pricing#team-&-enterprise). For questions about Claude for Life Sciences for your organization, contact our [Sales team](https://claude.com/contact-sales/life-sciences).

## Scientific research and discovery connectors

Through Model Context Protocol (MCP) [connectors](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11724452-browsing-and-connecting-to-tools-from-the-directory) and [desktop extensions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10949351-getting-started-with-local-mcp-servers-on-claude-desktop), Claude connects directly to leading platforms and databases, enabling you to query data using natural language and receive responses with source citations.

- **[Benchling](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12614810-using-the-benchling-extension-in-claude)** connects Claude to Benchling R&D platform data, enabling scientists to ask questions and receive clear summaries with links back to source experiments, notebooks, and structured records—all while maintaining existing access permissions.

- **[10x Genomics](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12614803-using-the-10x-genomics-extension-in-claude)\*** transforms single cell and spatial analysis into a simple, conversational workflow. Biologists can easily analyze their own sequencing data, while core labs can quickly perform batch processing.

- **[PubMed](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12614801-using-the-pubmed-connector-in-claude)** provides access to millions of biomedical research articles and clinical studies, allowing Claude to access abstracts and full papers to clarify experimental approaches, identify key findings, determine novelty and applicability, and surface specific papers for deeper exploration

- **[Synapse.org](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12614798-using-the-synapse-org-connector-in-claude)** allows researchers to discover biomedical data across all of Synapse, see the structure of projects, and retrieve information on their data assets for authorized users.

- **[BioRender](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12614795-using-the-biorender-connector-in-claude)** searches BioRender’s extensive scientific figure template and icon collection for relevant content to create figures faster.

- **[Scholar Gateway by Wiley](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12614815-using-the-scholar-gateway-connector-in-claude)** provides authenticated access to the most relevant snippets of scientific research papers to utilize within Claude.

*\*Available as Desktop Extensions for access on Claude Desktop App ([download here](https://claude.ai/download)).*

Claude also includes Connectors to other workplace and productivity platforms like **Microsoft 365**, **Gmail & Google Drive**, **Box**, **Databricks**, **Slack**, and many more. Explore all available Claude Connectors [here](https://claude.com/partners/mcp).

Finally, custom connectors allow you to connect to tools that aren't yet listed in Claude's directory. Learn more about setting up custom connectors [here](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp).

## Common research & discovery use cases

- **Advanced data analysis and hypothesis generation:** Synthesize multi-source data to accelerate discovery cycles from weeks to hours.

- **Literature synthesis with citations:** Access abstracts and full papers to clarify experimental approaches, identify key findings, determine novelty and applicability, and surface specific papers for deeper exploration.

- **Protocol optimization:** Generate optimized protocols by synthesizing literature, successful existing protocols, and experimental best practices.

- **Single-cell data processing:** Synthesize days of bioinformatics and computational analysis in minutes with automated cell population identification. Check out the [single-cell-rna-qc skill](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12621831-how-to-use-the-single-cell-rna-qc-skill-with-claude) which gives Claude the ability to perform quality control on single-cell RNA-seq data using scverse best practices.

- **Experimental design automation:** Generate literature-informed experimental designs automatically.

- **Figure interpretation and analysis:** Accelerate figure creation and analysis with automated visualization.
