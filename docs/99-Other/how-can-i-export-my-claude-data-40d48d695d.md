Data exports are available to individual Claude users (free, Pro, and Max) with active accounts. Data exports include conversation data and the user data for your account.

Individual Claude users can export user information and chat history from Settings > Privacy on the web app or Claude Desktop (it's not possible to run an export from Claude for iOS or Android).

 

Follow these steps to export your data:

Click on your initials in the lower left corner of your account.

Select "Settings" from the menu.

Navigate to the "Privacy" section.

Click the "Export data" button.

Once the export has been processed, you will receive a download link via email.

 

Please note:

There may be a small delay while the export is generated.

The email will be sent to the address associated with your account.

You must be signed in to your account to download your data using this link.

The download link will expire 24 hours after delivery.

If your link expires, you can always request a new one by repeating the export process.

 

Can I import or migrate this data to another Claude account?

We do not support migrating data between separate accounts at this time.
