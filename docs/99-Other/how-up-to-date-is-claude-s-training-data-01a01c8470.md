While we're constantly updating Claude's data, each model has a knowledge cutoff:

Claude Opus 4.5 was trained on data up until August 2025.

Claude Haiku 4.5 was trained on data up until July 2025.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 was trained on data up until July 2025.

Claude Sonnet 4 was trained on data up until March 2025.

Claude Haiku 3.5 was trained on data up until July 2024.

Claude Opus 3 was trained on data up until August 2023.

These models may not be aware of events or information that occurred after their respective cutoff dates. If you ask about more recent events, the model may not have accurate information.
