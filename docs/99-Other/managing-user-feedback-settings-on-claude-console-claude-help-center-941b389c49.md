Managing User Feedback Settings on Claude Console

# Managing User Feedback Settings on Claude Console

Updated this week

As an Admin of your Claude Console account, you can manage the ability for members of your organization to submit feedback to Anthropic via thumbs up / thumbs down.

To manage feedback for your Console organization:

1.  Navigate to [Settings \> Privacy controls](https://platform.claude.com/settings/privacy).

2.  Toggle the feedback switch on or off.
