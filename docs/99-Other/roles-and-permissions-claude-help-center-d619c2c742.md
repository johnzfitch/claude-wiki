What an individual can see and do in their Team or Enterprise plan account is dictated by their role. Roles are provisioned with the following permissions.

**Important notes about the Primary Owner role:**

- Team and Enterprise organizations can only have one Primary Owner.

- The Primary Owner seat uses one of your plan's licenses.

- Your organization's Primary Owner can be a service account that isn't tied to an individual user.
