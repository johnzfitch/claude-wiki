Quick entry is a redesigned experience for Claude Desktop on Mac that lets you access Claude instantly from anywhere on your computer. With quick entry, you can start chats, capture screenshots, share application windows, and use voice dictation to interact with Claude without navigating away from your current task.

Quick entry is available to all Claude users (free, Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans) using Claude Desktop on macOS.

## Key features

Quick entry includes three main capabilities:

- **Instant access**: Double-tap the Option key to open Claude from any app.

- **Visual context**: Capture screenshots or click application windows to share what you're working on.

- **Voice input**: Press Caps Lock to dictate your message to Claude with real-time transcription.

## System requirements

To use quick entry, you need:

- macOS 12 or later for quick entry features

- macOS 14 or later for voice dictation

- Claude Desktop installed and running (can be in the background)

## Setting up quick entry

When you first open the updated version of Claude Desktop, you'll see a prompt to enable quick entry shortcuts.

### Enable the chat shortcut

1.  Check the box for **Turn on shortcut** in the quick entry prompt.

2.  Click "Continue."

3.  Double-tap the Option key to test the shortcut.

4.  Moving forward, manage this in Settings \> General (under **Desktop app**).

Once enabled, double-tapping Option will open a text box where you can type your message and start a new chat. You can also click "New chat" to see your five most recent conversations.

### Enable the voice shortcut (optional)

The voice dictation shortcut is disabled by default because it takes over your Caps Lock key.

To enable voice dictation:

1.  Check the box for **Turn on shortcut** in the voice dictation prompt.

2.  Click "Continue."

3.  Press Caps Lock once to start dictating.

4.  Press Caps Lock again when you're finished speaking.

## FAQ

### Do I need to keep Claude Desktop open to use quick entry?

Yes. Claude Desktop needs to be running on your Mac, but it can run in the background. You don't need to have the Claude window visible.

### Can I use quick entry on Windows?

No. Quick entry is currently only available for macOS users. Windows users can still access Claude Desktop, but without the quick entry features.

### Is my voice recorded when I use dictation?

Voice dictation transcribes your speech to text in real-time. The transcribed text is sent to Claude as part of your message, just like any other text input.

### Can I disable quick entry after enabling it?

Yes. You can disable quick entry shortcuts at any time in Settings \> General \> Desktop App. You can turn off the quick access shortcut, voice shortcut, or both.

### What if the shortcuts conflict with other apps?

You can customize the quick access shortcut to use Option + Space or create a custom keyboard shortcut that doesn't conflict with your other applications. The voice shortcut can only use Caps Lock or be disabled.
