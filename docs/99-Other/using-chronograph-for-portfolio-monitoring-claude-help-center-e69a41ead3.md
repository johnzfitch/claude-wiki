The Chronograph integration provides Claude with access to a portfolio monitoring platform that enables investment analysis and tracking. This article explains how to set up and use Chronograph to access portfolio data and investment insights. The Chronograph integration relies upon Claude’s ability to use remote connectors.

## What This Integration Provides

### Capabilities

The Chronograph integration enables Claude to access comprehensive portfolio and investment data.

- **Entity Search and Discovery:** Search for companies, funds, groups, and general partners via substring similarity search. The search helps you quickly locate relevant investment entities across Chronograph’s database.

- **Core Entity Information:** Retrieve detailed information about entities including their identifiers, core details, and filter options. This provides fundamental data needed for investment analysis.

- **Portfolio Exposure Tracking:** List your top company exposures by investment status (Invested, Realized, or Unrealized), along with detailed company information for portfolio monitoring and risk assessment.

- **Commitment History Analysis:** Calculate aggregate values for key metrics including NAV, Called, Distributed, Unfunded, Net IRR, Net MOIC, and Commitment Amount across your portfolio’s commitment history.

- **Investment Metrics Calculator:** Calculate individual metrics across specific investments, useful for aggregating and tracking performance. The calculator helps enumerate available metric options before running detailed queries.

- **Help Center Integration:** Access Chronograph’s help documentation directly through Claude. Search for relevant articles or retrieve complete article content to answer platform-specific questions.
