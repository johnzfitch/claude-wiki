When you first create a Claude account, you’ll be asked to enter your phone number from a [supported location](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8461763-where-can-i-access-claude) to receive a verification code via text message:

[](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/lupk8zyo/1893173143/de034a2e7d9a6ae1f703cf867afd/image.png?expires=1770722100&signature=cc53c97855532e8f4fe13655139e4a21d17bd627e6b2990b070e55163eb0d01f&req=dSguFch5noBbWvMW1HO4zVIf%2F5Bk3ih7oTnI%2BoMZk7fH%2F6BdAzI%2BUIKOdwt8%0AARKxGIKXrULScgVM71E%3D%0A)

Once you receive the text message with the code, type it into the box and click “Verify code.” This will complete the verification and account creation process and allow you to start chatting with Claude.

## Why do I need to verify my phone number?

Verifying your phone number helps us prevent spam and abuse. Your phone number is only used for account verification and not for any other purposes.

## What happens during phone verification?

We’ll send a six-digit verification code to your phone number via text message. Enter this code on the verification screen to confirm you have access to that phone number.

## Limitations

We only accept phone numbers from our supported locations at this time. Additionally, you cannot use VoIP numbers, Google Voice, phone numbers created using apps, landlines, or other numbers that can’t receive texts to verify your account.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I don't have a phone number from a supported location?

Only users physically located in one of our supported locations can create and use Claude accounts. We also require a phone number from a supported location to create an account, and there isn’t a way to skip this step.

### I don't have a phone that can receive text messages. How can I create an account?

You must have a phone number that can receive a verification code via text message to create and use a Claude account. We require phone verification for all new users, and there isn’t a way to skip this step.

### I didn't receive my phone verification code. What should I do?

The code may take a few minutes to arrive via text, but if it has been more than five minutes, click “Try again” to reset the modal and reenter your phone number, ensuring that you’re entering the correct one.

### I’m still not receiving the code, or I’m seeing “Error sending code. Double check your phone number.”

If you aren’t receiving a verification code via text after reentering your phone number, or you’re seeing an error message (“Error sending code. Double check your phone number.”), you’ll need to try using a different phone number to verify your account.

### I received the text message with the verification code, but the code isn’t working.

The texted verification codes are temporary, so ensure you’re entering the most recent code you received. You can use “Try again” to restart the verification and receive a new code, so you should request one and enter it as soon as you receive it

### Why am I seeing a message stating that my phone number was used too many times?

If you see an error stating that your phone number is already in use, this means there’s another Claude account in our system that was verified using that number. If you know which email address is associated with this verified account, you should log in to that account and contact our Support team to ask for help unlinking your phone number from it. Once we unlink the number, you’ll be able to use it to verify a different account.

Alternatively, you can enter a different phone number that hasn’t been used for verification yet.

### Can I change the phone number associated with my account?

There isn’t a way to change your phone number associated with your Claude account once it has been verified. Please ensure you verify your account using a phone number you'll have access to long-term.
