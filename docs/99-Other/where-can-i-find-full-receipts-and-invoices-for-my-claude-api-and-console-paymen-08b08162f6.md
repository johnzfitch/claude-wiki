# Where can I find full receipts and invoices for my Claude API and Console payments?

Updated this week

Invoices are visible to Console Billing and Admin roles.

Follow these steps to view your Console invoices:

1.  Log in to the Console with an Admin or Billing role.

2.  Navigate to [Console Settings \> Billing](https://platform.claude.com/settings/billing).

3.  Find the **Invoice history** section.

4.  Click the "View" or "Download" button next to the invoice you want to open.

5.  Clicking "Download" will automatically start the file download

6.  Clicking "View" opens a new Stripe tab where you can click "Download invoice."

Additionally, after each purchase, we automatically send them to your registered billing email address.

For help accessing older receipts and invoices not available in the Claude Console, please [contact our Support team](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support).
